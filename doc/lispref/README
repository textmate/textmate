README for the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.

* This directory contains the texinfo source files for the Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual.

* Report bugs in the Lisp Manual (or in Emacs) using M-x report-emacs-bug.
To ask questions, use the help-gnu-emacs mailing list.

* The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual is quite large.  It totals around
1100 pages in smallbook format; the info files total around 3.0 megabytes.

* You can format this manual for Info, for printing hardcopy using TeX,
or for HTML.

* You can buy nicely printed copies from the Free Software Foundation.
Buying a manual from the Free Software Foundation helps support our GNU
development work.  See <http://shop.fsf.org/>.
(At time of writing, this manual is out of print.)

* The master file for formatting this manual for Tex is called `elisp.texi'.
It contains @include commands to include all the chapters that make up
the manual.

* This distribution contains a Makefile that you can use with GNU Make.

** To make an Info file, you need to install Texinfo, then run `make info'.

** Use `make elisp.pdf' or `make elisp.html' to create PDF or HTML versions.
