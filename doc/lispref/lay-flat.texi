We have bound this manual using a new @dfn{lay-flat} binding
technology.  This type of binding allows you to open a soft cover book
so that it ``lays flat'' on a table without creasing the binding.

In order to make the book lay flat properly, you need to ``crack'' the
binding.  To do this, divide the book into two sections and bend it so
that the front and back covers meet.  Do not worry; the pages are
sewn and glued to the binding, and will not fall out easily.
The outer cardboard binding itself is designed so that it will not
break or crease as an ordinary paperback binding will.  Bend the book
several times in this manner, dividing it in a different place each
time and pressing the pages flat and open.  With use, the binding will
become flexible and the pages will lay flat without needing to be
pushed or held down.
