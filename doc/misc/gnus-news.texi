@item Installation changes

@itemize @bullet
@item Upgrading from previous (stable) version if you have used No Gnus.

If you have tried No Gnus (the unstable Gnus branch leading to this
release) but went back to a stable version, be careful when upgrading
to this version.  In particular, you will probably want to remove the
@file{~/News/marks} directory (perhaps selectively), so that flags are
read from your @file{~/.newsrc.eld} instead of from the stale marks
file, where this release will store flags for nntp.  See a later entry
for more information about nntp marks.  Note that downgrading isn't
safe in general.

@item Incompatibility when switching from Emacs 23 to Emacs 22 
In Emacs 23, Gnus uses Emacs's new internal coding system @code{utf-8-emacs}
for saving articles drafts and @file{~/.newsrc.eld}.  These files may not
be read correctly in Emacs 22 and below.  If you want to use Gnus across
different Emacs versions, you may set @code{mm-auto-save-coding-system}
to @code{emacs-mule}.
@c FIXME: Untested.  (Or did anyone test it?)
@c Cf. http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.general/66251/focus=66344

@item Lisp files are now installed in @file{.../site-lisp/gnus/} by default.
It defaulted to @file{.../site-lisp/} formerly.  In addition to this,
the new installer issues a warning if other Gnus installations which
will shadow the latest one are detected.  You can then remove those
shadows manually or remove them using @code{make
remove-installed-shadows}.

@item The installation directory name is allowed to have spaces and/or tabs.
@end itemize

@item New packages and libraries within Gnus

@itemize @bullet

@item New version of @code{nnimap}

@code{nnimap} has been reimplemented in a mostly-compatible way.  See
the Gnus manual for a description of the new interface.  In
particular, @code{nnimap-inbox} and the client side split method has
changed.

@item Gnus includes the Emacs Lisp @acronym{SASL} library.

This provides a clean @acronym{API} to @acronym{SASL} mechanisms from
within Emacs.  The user visible aspects of this, compared to the earlier
situation, include support for @acronym{DIGEST}-@acronym{MD5} and
@acronym{NTLM}.   @xref{Top, ,Emacs SASL, sasl, Emacs SASL}.

@item ManageSieve connections uses the @acronym{SASL} library by default.

The primary change this brings is support for @acronym{DIGEST-MD5} and
@acronym{NTLM}, when the server supports it.

@item Gnus includes a password cache mechanism in password.el.

It is enabled by default (see @code{password-cache}), with a short
timeout of 16 seconds (see @code{password-cache-expiry}).  If
@acronym{PGG} is used as the @acronym{PGP} back end, the @acronym{PGP}
passphrase is managed by this mechanism.  Passwords for ManageSieve
connections are managed by this mechanism, after querying the user
about whether to do so.

@item Using EasyPG with Gnus
When EasyPG, is available, Gnus will use it instead of @acronym{PGG}.
EasyPG is an Emacs user interface to GNU Privacy Guard.  @xref{Top,
,EasyPG Assistant user's manual, epa, EasyPG Assistant user's manual}.
EasyPG is included in Emacs 23 and available separately as well.

@item Changes in group mode
@c ************************

@itemize @bullet

@item
Symbols like @code{gcc-self} now have the same precedence rules in
@code{gnus-parameters} as other ``real'' variables: The last match
wins instead of the first match.

@item
Old intermediate incoming mail files (@file{Incoming*}) are deleted
after a couple of days, not immediately.  @xref{Mail Source
Customization}.
(New in Gnus 5.10.10 / No Gnus 0.8)
@c This entry is also present in the node "Oort Gnus".

@end itemize

@item Changes in summary and article mode

@itemize @bullet

@item There's now only one variable that determines how @acronym{HTML}
is rendered: @code{mm-text-html-renderer}.

@item Gnus now supports sticky article buffers.  Those are article buffers
that are not reused when you select another article.  @xref{Sticky
Articles}.

@c @item Bookmarks
@c FIXME: To be added

@item Gnus can selectively display @samp{text/html} articles
with a WWW browser with @kbd{K H}.  @xref{MIME Commands}.

@c gnus-registry-marks
@c FIXME: To be added

@item International host names (@acronym{IDNA}) can now be decoded
inside article bodies using @kbd{W i}
(@code{gnus-summary-idna-message}).  This requires that GNU Libidn
(@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/}) has been installed.
@c FIXME: Also mention @code{message-use-idna}?

@item The non-@acronym{ASCII} group names handling has been much
improved.  The back ends that fully support non-@acronym{ASCII} group
names are now @code{nntp}, @code{nnml}, and @code{nnrss}.  Also the
agent, the cache, and the marks features work with those back ends.
@xref{Non-ASCII Group Names}.

@item Gnus now displays @acronym{DNS} master files sent as text/dns
using dns-mode.

@item Gnus supports new limiting commands in the Summary buffer:
@kbd{/ r} (@code{gnus-summary-limit-to-replied}) and @kbd{/ R}
(@code{gnus-summary-limit-to-recipient}).  @xref{Limiting}.

@item You can now fetch all ticked articles from the server using
@kbd{Y t} (@code{gnus-summary-insert-ticked-articles}).  @xref{Summary
Generation Commands}.

@item Gnus supports a new sort command in the Summary buffer:
@kbd{C-c C-s C-t} (@code{gnus-summary-sort-by-recipient}).  @xref{Summary
Sorting}.

@item @acronym{S/MIME} now features @acronym{LDAP} user certificate searches.
You need to configure the server in @code{smime-ldap-host-list}.

@item URLs inside Open@acronym{PGP} headers are retrieved and imported
to your PGP key ring when you click on them.

@item
Picons can be displayed right from the textual address, see
@code{gnus-picon-style}.  @xref{Picons}.

@item @acronym{ANSI} @acronym{SGR} control sequences can be transformed
using @kbd{W A}.

@acronym{ANSI} sequences are used in some Chinese hierarchies for
highlighting articles (@code{gnus-article-treat-ansi-sequences}).

@item Gnus now MIME decodes articles even when they lack "MIME-Version" header.
This changes the default of @code{gnus-article-loose-mime}.

@item @code{gnus-decay-scores} can be a regexp matching score files.
For example, set it to @samp{\\.ADAPT\\'} and only adaptive score files
will be decayed.  @xref{Score Decays}.

@item Strings prefixing to the @code{To} and @code{Newsgroup} headers in
summary lines when using @code{gnus-ignored-from-addresses} can be
customized with @code{gnus-summary-to-prefix} and
@code{gnus-summary-newsgroup-prefix}.  @xref{To From Newsgroups}.

@item You can replace @acronym{MIME} parts with external bodies.
See @code{gnus-mime-replace-part} and @code{gnus-article-replace-part}.
@xref{MIME Commands}, @ref{Using MIME}.

@item
The option @code{mm-fill-flowed} can be used to disable treatment of
format=flowed messages.  Also, flowed text is disabled when sending
inline @acronym{PGP} signed messages.  @xref{Flowed text, ,Flowed text,
emacs-mime, The Emacs MIME Manual}.  (New in Gnus 5.10.7)
@c This entry is also present in the node "Oort Gnus".

@item Now the new command @kbd{S W}
(@code{gnus-article-wide-reply-with-original}) for a wide reply in the
article buffer yanks a text that is in the active region, if it is set,
as well as the @kbd{R} (@code{gnus-article-reply-with-original}) command.
Note that the @kbd{R} command in the article buffer no longer accepts a
prefix argument, which was used to make it do a wide reply.
@xref{Article Keymap}.

@item The new command @kbd{C-h b}
(@code{gnus-article-describe-bindings}) used in the article buffer now
shows not only the article commands but also the real summary commands
that are accessible from the article buffer.

@end itemize

@item Changes in Message mode

@itemize @bullet
@item Gnus now defaults to saving all outgoing messages in per-month
nnfolder archives.

@item Gnus now supports the ``hashcash'' client puzzle anti-spam mechanism.
Use @code{(setq message-generate-hashcash t)} to enable.
@xref{Hashcash}.

@item You can now drag and drop attachments to the Message buffer.
See @code{mml-dnd-protocol-alist} and @code{mml-dnd-attach-options}.
@xref{MIME, ,MIME, message, Message Manual}.

@item The option @code{message-yank-empty-prefix} now controls how
empty lines are prefixed in cited text.  @xref{Insertion Variables,
,Insertion Variables, message, Message Manual}.

@item Gnus uses narrowing to hide headers in Message buffers.
The @code{References} header is hidden by default.  To make all
headers visible, use @code{(setq message-hidden-headers nil)}.
@xref{Message Headers, ,Message Headers, message, Message Manual}.

@item You can highlight different levels of citations like in the
article buffer.  See @code{gnus-message-highlight-citation}.

@item @code{auto-fill-mode} is enabled by default in Message mode.
See @code{message-fill-column}.  @xref{Various Message Variables, ,
Message Headers, message, Message Manual}.

@item You can now store signature files in a special directory
named @code{message-signature-directory}.

@item The option @code{message-citation-line-format} controls the format
of the "Whomever writes:" line.  You need to set
@code{message-citation-line-function} to
@code{message-insert-formatted-citation-line} as well.
@end itemize

@item Changes in Browse Server mode

@itemize @bullet
@item Gnus' sophisticated subscription methods are now available in
Browse Server buffers as well using the variable
@code{gnus-browse-subscribe-newsgroup-method}.

@end itemize


@item Changes in back ends

@itemize @bullet
@item The nntp back end stores article marks in @file{~/News/marks}.

The directory can be changed using the (customizable) variable
@code{nntp-marks-directory}, and marks can be disabled using the
(back end) variable @code{nntp-marks-is-evil}.  The advantage of this
is that you can copy @file{~/News/marks} (using rsync, scp or
whatever) to another Gnus installation, and it will realize what
articles you have read and marked.  The data in @file{~/News/marks}
has priority over the same data in @file{~/.newsrc.eld}.

@item
You can import and export your @acronym{RSS} subscriptions from
@acronym{OPML} files.  @xref{RSS}.

@item @acronym{IMAP} identity (@acronym{RFC} 2971) is supported.

By default, Gnus does not send any information about itself, but you can
customize it using the variable @code{nnimap-id}.

@item The @code{nnrss} back end now supports multilingual text.
Non-@acronym{ASCII} group names for the @code{nnrss} groups are also
supported.  @xref{RSS}.

@item Retrieving mail with @acronym{POP3} is supported over @acronym{SSL}/@acronym{TLS} and with StartTLS.

@item The nnml back end allows other compression programs beside @file{gzip}
for compressed message files.  @xref{Mail Spool}.

@item The nnml back end supports group compaction.

This feature, accessible via the functions
@code{gnus-group-compact-group} (@kbd{G z} in the group buffer) and
@code{gnus-server-compact-server} (@kbd{z} in the server buffer)
renumbers all articles in a group, starting from 1 and removing gaps.
As a consequence, you get a correct total article count (until
messages are deleted again).

@item Appearance
@c Maybe it's not worth to separate this from "Miscellaneous"?

@itemize @bullet

@item The tool bar has been updated to use GNOME icons.
You can also customize the tool bars: @kbd{M-x customize-apropos RET
-tool-bar$} should get you started.  (Only for Emacs, not in XEmacs.)
@c FIXME: Document this in the manual

@item The tool bar icons are now (de)activated correctly
in the group buffer, see the variable @code{gnus-group-update-tool-bar}.
Its default value depends on your Emacs version.
@c FIXME: Document this in the manual

@item You can change the location of XEmacs's toolbars in Gnus buffers.
See @code{gnus-use-toolbar} and @code{message-use-toolbar}.

@end itemize

@item Miscellaneous changes

@itemize @bullet
@item Having edited the select-method for the foreign server in the
server buffer is immediately reflected to the subscription of the groups
which use the server in question.  For instance, if you change
@code{nntp-via-address} into @samp{bar.example.com} from
@samp{foo.example.com}, Gnus will connect to the news host by way of the
intermediate host @samp{bar.example.com} from next time.

@item The @file{all.SCORE} file can be edited from the group buffer
using @kbd{W e}.

@item You can set @code{gnus-mark-copied-or-moved-articles-as-expirable}
to a non-@code{nil} value so that articles that have been read may be
marked as expirable automatically when copying or moving them to a group
that has auto-expire turned on.  The default is @code{nil} and copying
and moving of articles behave as before; i.e., the expirable marks will
be unchanged except that the marks will be removed when copying or
moving articles to a group that has not turned auto-expire on.
@xref{Expiring Mail}.

@item NoCeM support has been removed.

@item Carpal mode has been removed.
