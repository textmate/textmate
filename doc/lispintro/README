This directory contains the source of the "Introduction to Programming
in Emacs Lisp" written by Robert J. Chassell, bob@gnu.org.  This
manual is an elementary introduction to programming in Emacs Lisp for
people who are not programmers, and who are not necessarily interested
in programming, but who do want to customize or extend their computing
environment.

This third edition of 2006 Oct 31 updates the previous editions to GNU
Emacs 22.

The Texinfo source file `emacs-lisp-intro.texi', formats without
reported error using `pdfeTeXk', Version 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C
7.5.4) and texinfo.tex version 2006-08-26.17 started by `texi2dvi'
version 4.8, and with `makeinfo' version 4.8.

This directory contains the following Encapsulated PostScript figures:

  cons-1.eps, cons-2.eps, cons-2a.eps, cons-3.eps, cons-4.eps, cons-5.eps
  drawers.eps, lambda-1.eps, lambda-2.eps, lambda-3.eps

See the beginning of the `emacs-lisp-intro.texi' file for appropriate
settings.  These figures are not necessary; they are merely nice to
look at --- without them you get the same figures printed with ASCII
characters.

Whether and how you print PostScript depends on your site.  You not
only need to set 'print-postscript-figures' before creating the .dvi
file, but then must convert the .dvi file to .ps with a 'dvips' or
equivalent command.

On some systems you will see an error message when `psfig.tex' is
loaded for the last two .eps files:

            ! No room for a new \write .

If this happens, try `epsf.tex' instead of `psfig.tex', or try typing
RET at the error; the formatting may continue successfully.

Or else find the section that says:

 @c !!! Clear print-postscript-figures if the computer formatting this
 @c     document is too small and cannot handle all the diagrams and figures.
 @c clear print-postscript-figures

and change the file so it reads:   @clear print-postscript-figures
This will prevent TeX from attempting to load the last few .eps files.

You will find additional instructions on formatting in the beginning
of the Texinfo file 'emacs-lisp-intro.texi'.  Best Wishes!
