Here’s how TaskPaper reads a ﬁle
--------------------------------
(taken from the TaskPaper User's Guide as of v. 2.3.2. Copy: http://is.gd/JXUr6D)

* Files are expected to use the UTF-8 encoding and use ‘\n’ to separate lines.

* A task is a line that begins with a hyphen followed by a space ('- ') which
can optionally be preﬁxed (i.e indented) with tabs or spaces. A task can have
zero or more tags anywhere on the line (not just trailing at the end).

* A project is a line that isn't a task and ends with a colon (':'), or a colon
(':\n') followed by a newline. Tags can exist after the colon, but if any
non-tag text is present, then it won’t be recognized as a project.

* A note is any line that doesn't match the task or project rules.

* Indentation level (with tabs, not spaces) deﬁnes ownership. For instance, if
you indent one task under another task, then it is considered a subtask. Tasks
and notes own all objects that are indented underneath them. Empty lines are
ignored when calculating ownership.

* A tag has the form "@tag", i.e. it starts with an "at" character ("@"),
followed by a run of non-whitespace characters. A tag can optionally have a
value assigned to it. The value syntax immediately follows the tag word (no
whitespace between) and is enclosed by parentheses: '(' and ')'. The value text
inside can have whitespace, but no newlines. Here is an example of a tag with a
value: @tag(tag's value).

The rest of this file exemplifies the spec
------------------------------------------
All the lines up to this one have been notes that don't belong to any project or task

- This is a task that doesn't belong to a project

A project with some nesting and notes:
- task one
- task two
	- subtask a
		this task has (owns) a note
	- subtask b
		- sub-subtask c
		  another note
- task three
It's unclear from the spec which project this note belongs to.
We're going to presume it belongs to the preceeding project.
Also, we read the spec as requiring these three lines to be three separate notes (?).
This project is: @tagged
- and so is this @task
- this @tag(has a value)
- this one has tags @mixed in @with the text
- and @this(one) has @both
- this is not a project even though it ends with a colon:
This is a note even though it contains a colon: and a dash - and @tags
	- this is a subtask of a note (which is kinda weird IMO)

	- and the whitespace above should be ignored resulting in this also being a subtask

Things we are not worrying about for now...
* nested @tags(like @this(!)) - not sure if this is allowed by the spec?
