/* lstat works differently on Linux and Solaris systems.  POSIX (see
   `pathname resolution' in the glossary) requires that programs like
   `ls' take into consideration the fact that FILE has a trailing slash
   when FILE is a symbolic link.  On Linux and Solaris 10 systems, the
   lstat function already has the desired semantics (in treating
   `lstat ("symlink/", sbuf)' just like `lstat ("symlink/.", sbuf)',
   but on Solaris 9 and earlier it does not.

   If FILE has a trailing slash and specifies a symbolic link,
   then use stat() to get more info on the referent of FILE.
   If the referent is a non-directory, then set errno to ENOTDIR
   and return -1.  Otherwise, return stat's result.  */
