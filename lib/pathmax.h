/* POSIX:2008 defines PATH_MAX to be the maximum number of bytes in a filename,
   including the terminating NUL byte.
   <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html>
   PATH_MAX is not defined on systems which have no limit on filename length,
   such as GNU/Hurd.

   This file does *not* define PATH_MAX always.  Programs that use this file
   can handle the GNU/Hurd case in several ways:
     - Either with a package-wide handling, or with a per-file handling,
     - Either through a
         #ifdef PATH_MAX
       or through a fallback like
         #ifndef PATH_MAX
         # define PATH_MAX 8192
         #endif
       or through a fallback like
         #ifndef PATH_MAX
         # define PATH_MAX pathconf ("/", _PC_PATH_MAX)
         #endif
