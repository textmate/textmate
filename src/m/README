This directory contains C header files containing machine-specific
definitions.  Each file describes a particular machine.  The emacs
configuration script edits ../config.h to include the appropriate one of
these files, and then each emacs source file includes config.h.

template.h is a generic template for machine descriptions; it
describes the parameters a machine file can specify.
