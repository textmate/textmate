This directory contains C header files containing
operating-system-specific definitions.  Each file describes a
particular operating system.  The emacs configuration script edits
../config.h to include the appropriate one of these files, and then
each emacs source file includes config.h.

template.h is a generic template for system descriptions; it describes
the parameters a system file can specify.
