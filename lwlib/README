This subdirectory contains the Lucid Widget Library (lwlib), which
provides a uniform interface to a few different X toolkits.  The
library was written by Lucid, Inc and released under the terms of the
GPL version 1 (or later).  It is not considered part of GNU Emacs.

This version of the library differs from the original as described in
