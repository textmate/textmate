  "These are some images of a 3D stylized gnu head that I created back
  in 1998. I started studying pictures of gnus and wildebeests and
  worked with a 3D modeller, sPatch, until I came up with these. Then
  I worked to make them into icons - cropping the horns off the sides
  so the images were big enough to be recognizable (to me anyway)."
