;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides the generic handling of the drop part only.
;; Different DND backends (X11, W32, etc.) that handle the platform
;; specific DND parts call the functions here to do final delivery of
;; a drop.

The list contains of (REGEXP . FUNCTION) pairs.
The functions shall take two arguments, URL, which is the URL dropped and
ACTION which is the action to be performed for the drop (move, copy, link,
private or ask).
If no match is found here, and the value of `browse-url-browser-function'
