	* vc-hooks.el: The RCS status is now found by reading the
	master file directly, instead of using rlog.  The properties
	retrieved from the master file are kept separately.  The two
	main properties, `vc-workfile-version' and `vc-locking-user',
	are inferred from those master file properties if the
	information cannot be found elsehow.  All properties are
	consistently cached now.

	Reordered some defuns so they are grouped in a logical way.

	(vc-master-info, vc-log-info, vc-fetch-properties): Functions removed.
	Their job is now done by `vc-fetch-master-properties'

	(vc-locking-user): Slightly changed to use the new properties.
	Changed the actual property value for an unlocked file to
	'none.  This is to distinguish it from an unknown locking
	state, which is represented by nil.  The function vc-locking-user
	returns nil if the property is 'none, to make it compatible with
	the rest of VC.

	(vc-consult-rcs-headers, vc-master-locking-user): Adapted to
	the new 'none-value of vc-locking-user.

	(vc-consult-rcs-headers): Fixed bug that prevented
	(not vc-consult-headers) from working.

	(vc-file-not-found-hook): Set the default-directory of the new
	buffer before check-out.

	* vc.el: Adapt to the changes in vc-hooks.el, namely, the new
	'none-value of vc-locking-user, and the consistent caching
	of all properties.  Especially, make the properties survive
	check-ins and check-outs.  Various minor bug fixes.

	(vc-file-clear-masterprops): New function.

	(vc-backend-checkin, vc-backend-revert): Set vc-locking-user
	to 'none if the file is unlocked.

	(vc-backend-checkin, vc-backend-revert, vc-backend-checkout):
	Use vc-file-clear-masterprops, and adjust those properties
	that are not cleared.

	(vc-resynch-window): Temporarily remove vc-find-file-hook, so
	that we don't lose the file properties during check-in/out.

	(vc-resynch-window): Do not try to delete the current window if
	`vc-keep-workfiles' is nil (doesn't make sense; killing the
	buffer is enough.)

	(vc-backend-checkin): Rewrote the code that adjusts the default
	branch and removes any locks that might remain after check-in.

	(vc-cancel-version): Abort with error message in the CVS case.
	(The error used to be signaled in vc-backend-uncheck, which is
	a little too late.)

	(vc-minor-revision): Function removed.

	apply abbreviate-file-name to it and then use its directory part

	part.  Fix prompting code not to use a free variable.
	(compilation-parse-errors, compile-abbreviate-directory):

	function locally only.

	simple cases unless we are either paging or term-scroll-with-delete.

	Internally, use an alist instead of hardcoded list-positions

	(bookmark-buffer-file-name): Handle Info files.
	(bookmark-buffer-name): If Info mode, return Info-current-node.
	(bookmark-jump-noselect): For info node, use Info-goto-node.
	Use the helper functions, don't mess with the raw
	alist (except in completion, which we'll take care of later).
	Don't count on `bookmark-search-size' being correct; use the
	length of `forward-str' and `behind-str' instead.
	(bookmark-relocate): Use the helper functions; don't mess
	with the raw alist except in completion.
	(bookmark-rename): C-o in minibuffer now inserts old name.

	Doc fix.
	(looking-at-hard): Deleted, not needed.
	(forward-paragraph): Removes ^ from beginning of regexps, if
	required.  Look for paragraph-start and paragraph-separate at
	left-margin, not BOL.  Lines with just left-margin indentation are
	treated like blank lines.
	Paragraph-separate no longer requires a preceding hard newline, but
	paragraph-start does: paragraph-separates usually won't occur by
	accident, so it doesn't hurt to respect them whenever they do occur.

1995-03-01  Richard Stallman  <rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* vc.el (vc-do-command): Search vc-path first, not last.

1995-02-26  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	?0 instead of more obscure 48.

1995-02-24  Lars Lindberg  <Lars.Lindberg@sypro.cap.se>

	(msb--few-menus, msb--very-many-menus): Added rmail-edit-mode.

1995-02-21  Boris Goldowsky  <boris@cs.rochester.edu>

	* fill.el (set-fill-prefix): Sets it to the text between
	left-margin and point, not the whole line before point.

	(fill-region-as-paragraph): Set `from' to the beginning and
	`to' to the end immediately, for clarity.  This used to be
	done after the save-restriction.

	Newlines at end of region used to be changed to spaces, then
	deleted.  Now delete them (all but one) explicitly, so that we
	can test whether they are hard and not delete hard newlines.

	Ignore all whitespace at beginning of region: a line
	containing spaces before first line of text used to be joined
	onto first line of text, making spurious paragraph indentation.

	If there is only whitespace in the region, exit quickly (fixed
	possible infinite-loop condition).

	Moved the loop that just indents when justification=none inside
	the save-restriction.  It's a little simpler that way.

	When deleting indentation and fill-prefixes from lines, delete
	any whitespace after the fill-prefix too.

	Always exit with point at end of region, after a single
	paragraph-final newline.

	(fill-region): Don't use paragraph-movement commands
	in use-hard-newlines mode; just fill between each pair of hard
	newlines.  Old strategy of setting paragraph-start to "^"
	doesn't work, since paragraph-start no longer no longer need
	occur at BOL.

	(current-justification): Don't look for text-props at EOB:
	there are none.

	(set-justification): New arg WHOLE-PAR controls whether to trust
	begin and end args in noninteractive use, or extend to limits of
	paragraphs.
	Don't use "^" in paragraph-start regexp.
	Ignore fill-prefix when searching for enclosing paragraph with
	use-hard-newlines true.
	Squeeze spaces from regions that used to be full-justified.
	Remove leftover debugging code.

	(set-justification-{none,left,right,full,center}): Use WHOLE-PAR
	arg of set-justification.  Interactive spec changed to avoid
	errors when there is no region.

	(justify-current-line): Error if JUSTIFY value is not one of
	the meaningful symbols (used to do full justification in this case);
	change interactive spec to explicitly request full justification.

	Don't need to save-restriction & narrow (except for full-justify).
	Explicitly remember beginning position, so that we can move it
	to after indentation if that is appropriate.
	Save a few more useful quantities; add documentation of variables used.

	Do nothing if there is no text on the line.

	Notice adaptive-fill fill-prefixes too.

	Center or flushright indentation is put between fill-prefix
	and text; can't use standard line-indent function for this.

	If centering, do so between left and right margins.

	Warning messages ("line too long") removed; they were annoying
	in auto-fill-mode.

	(unjustify-current-line, unjustify-region): New functions.

	* indent.el (indent-line-to): Don't need `let'.

	(current-left-margin): Don't look for text-props at EOB.

	(move-to-left-margin): Always move to left-margin, even in
	centered or right-justified regions.
	New arg FORCE to add indentation or convert tabs to spaces if
	necessary.  FORCE is the interactive default; it used to be
	available only interactively.

	(indent-to-left-margin): Doc fix.

	(delete-to-left-margin): Use move-to-left-margin.  Doc fix.
	Make arguments optional.

	(set-left-margin): Make region include following spaces and tabs,
	so that later insertions there will inherit new setting.
	Always reindent text to show new setting, not only when auto-fill
	is active; auto-fill controls only whether to re-fill text.
	(set-left-margin, increase-left-margin): Use indent-rigidly to
	change indentation level.
	(set-left-margin, set-right-margin, increase-left-margin):
	Save point when calling fill-region.
	(increase-left-margin): `left-margin' property can be
	negative, for outdenting, up to the value of the left-margin variable.
	(increase-right-margin): `right-margin' property can be arbitrarily
	negative.  Negative values can't be stored in text/enriched
	format, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't allow it in general.

	(beginning-of-line-text): New function.

	* simple.el (open-line): Indent to left-margin any lines that
	you would consider inserting a fill-prefix on.

	(do-auto-fill): Use unjustify-current-line.

	(indent-new-comment-line): Indent to left-margin before inserting
	fill-prefix.

	* facemenu.el (facemenu-justification-menu): "Unfilled" now bound
	to set-justification-none; fn changed name.

	* loadup.el: Load version.el early on.

	default-directory.

	* mouse.el (mouse-buffer-menu): Use list-buffers-directory if

	(bibtex-entry-field-alist): Changed order of entries slightly to

	(bibtex-entry): Fixed bug (False entry wasn't reported in error
	message if bibtex-entry was called with undefined reference name).
	(bibtex-entry-field-alist, bibtex-entry, bibtex-make-field,
	bibtex-next-field, bibtex-clean-entry): Every reference entry now
	contains a comment in addition to the name of the reference.  This
	comment appears in the echo area if you start editing that field
	(after calling bibtex-next-field).
	(bibtex-include-OPTcrossref, bibtex-entry): Changed
	bibtex-include-OPTcrossref from single boolean variable to hold a
	list of reference names which should have a crossref field.
	(bibtex-complete-word): New function, which completes word
	fragment before point to the longest prefix of predefined strings
	in the buffer in the same way that ispell-complete-word operates
	for words found in the dictionary.
	(bibtex-reference-head): Start of bibtex-reference-head changed
	from "^[ \t]*\\(" to "^\\( \\|\t\\)*\\(" (bibtex-pop-previous and
	bibtex-pop-next didn't work, probably due to a bug in
	re-search-forward).
	(several functions): Added support for {} as field delimiters
	(better than '"' for accented characters).
	(bibtex-clean-entry): If optional field crossref is empty or
	missing, former optional fields (if bibtex-include-OPTcrossref was
	t) are necessary again.  bibtex-clean-entry complains if they are
	empty but not if they are missing, so you can intentionally omit
	them, e. g. for a pseudo @Journal entry (needed for
	crossreferences) made out of an @article with missing non-optional
	fields.
	Menu bar entries aren't centered anymore.
