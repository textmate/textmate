;;; Commentary:

;; HACKERS NOTE: There's heavy macro magic here.  If you need to make
;; changes in this or other files containing `c-lang-defconst' but
;; don't want to read through the longer discussion below then read
;; this:
;;
;; o  A change in a `c-lang-defconst' or `c-lang-defvar' will not take
;;    effect if the file containing the mode init function (typically
;;    cc-mode.el) is byte compiled.
;; o  To make changes show in font locking you need to reevaluate the
;;    `*-font-lock-keywords-*' constants, which normally is easiest to
;;    do with M-x eval-buffer in cc-fonts.el.
;; o  In either case it's necessary to reinitialize the mode to make
;;    the changes show in an existing buffer.

;;; Introduction to the language dependent variable system:
;;
;; This file contains all the language dependent variables, except
;; those specific for font locking which reside in cc-fonts.el.  As
;; far as possible, all the differences between the languages that CC
;; Mode supports are described with these variables only, so that the
;; code can be shared.
;;
;; The language constant system (see cc-defs.el) is used to specify
;; various language dependent info at a high level, such as lists of
;; keywords, and then from them generate - at compile time - the
;; various regexps and other low-level structures actually employed in
;; the code at runtime.
;;
;; This system is also designed to make it easy for developers of
;; derived modes to customize the source constants for new language
;; variants, without having to keep up with the exact regexps etc that
;; are used in each CC Mode version.  It's possible from an external
;; package to add a new language by inheriting an existing one, and
;; then change specific constants as necessary for the new language.
;; The old values for those constants (and the values of all the other
;; high-level constants) may be used to build the new ones, and those
;; new values will in turn be used by the low-level definitions here
;; to build the runtime constants appropriately for the new language
;; in the current version of CC Mode.
;;
;; Like elsewhere in CC Mode, the existence of a doc string signifies
;; that a language constant is part of the external API, and that it
;; therefore can be used with a high confidence that it will continue
;; to work with future versions of CC Mode.  Even so, it's not
;; unlikely that such constants will change meaning slightly as this
;; system is refined further; a certain degree of dependence on the CC
;; Mode version is unavoidable when hooking in at this level.  Also
;; note that there's still work to be done to actually use these
;; constants everywhere inside CC Mode; there are still hardcoded
;; values in many places in the code.
;;
;; Separate packages will also benefit from the compile time
;; evaluation; the byte compiled file(s) for them will contain the
;; compiled runtime constants ready for use by (the byte compiled) CC
;; Mode, and the source definitions in this file don't have to be
;; loaded then.  However, if a byte compiled package is loaded that
;; has been compiled with a different version of CC Mode than the one
;; currently loaded, then the compiled-in values will be discarded and
;; new ones will be built when the mode is initialized.  That will
;; automatically trig a load of the file(s) containing the source
;; definitions (i.e. this file and/or cc-fonts.el) if necessary.
;;
;; A small example of a derived mode is available at
;; <http://cc-mode.sourceforge.net/derived-mode-ex.el>.  It also
;; contains some useful hints for derived mode developers.

;;; Using language variables:
;;
;; The `c-lang-defvar' forms in this file comprise the language
;; variables that CC Mode uses.  It does not work to use
;; `c-lang-defvar' anywhere else (which isn't much of a limitation
;; since these variables sole purpose is to interface with the CC Mode
;; core functions).  The values in these `c-lang-defvar's are not
;; evaluated right away but instead collected to a single large `setq'
;; that can be inserted for a particular language with the
;; `c-init-language-vars' macro.

;; This file is only required at compile time, or when not running
;; from byte compiled files, or when the source definitions for the
;; language constants are requested.

;;; Code:

;; For Emacs < 22.2.

precedence, and the group has higher precedence than the groups in all
following elements.  The car of each element describes the type of the
operator group, and the cdr is a list of the operator tokens in it.
The operator group types are:

'prefix         Unary prefix operators.
'postfix        Unary postfix operators.
'postfix-if-paren
		Unary postfix operators if and only if the chars have
		parenthesis syntax.
'left-assoc     Binary left associative operators (i.e. a+b+c means (a+b)+c).
'right-assoc    Binary right associative operators (i.e. a=b=c means a=(b=c)).
'right-assoc-sequence
                Right associative operator that constitutes of a
                sequence of tokens that separate expressions.  All the
                tokens in the group are in this case taken as
                describing the sequence in one such operator, and the
                order between them is therefore significant.

Operators containing a character with paren syntax are taken to match
with a corresponding open/close paren somewhere else.  A postfix
operator with close paren syntax is taken to end a postfix expression
started somewhere earlier, rather than start a new one at point.  Vice
versa for prefix operators with open paren syntax.

Note that operators like \".\" and \"->\" which in language references
often are described as postfix operators are considered binary here,
since CC Mode treats every identifier as an expression."

  "Regexp matching something that might precede a declaration, cast or
label, such as the last token of a preceding statement or declaration.
This is used in the common situation where a declaration or cast
doesn't start with any specific token that can be searched for.

The regexp should not match bob; that is done implicitly.  It can't
require a match longer than one token.  The end of the token is taken
to be at the end of the first submatch, which is assumed to always
match.  It's undefined whether identifier syntax (see
`c-identifier-syntax-table') is in effect or not.  This regexp is
assumed to be a superset of `c-label-prefix-re' if
`c-recognize-colon-labels' is set.

Besides this, `c-decl-start-kwds' is used to find declarations.

Note: This variable together with `c-decl-start-re' and
`c-decl-start-kwds' is only used to detect \"likely\"
declaration/cast/label starts.  I.e. they might produce more matches
but should not miss anything (or else it's necessary to use text
properties - see the next note).  Wherever they match, the following
construct is analyzed to see if it indeed is a declaration, cast or
label.  That analysis is not cheap, so it's important that not too
many false matches are triggered.

Note: If a declaration/cast/label start can't be detected with this
variable, it's necessary to use the `c-type' text property with the
value `c-decl-end' on the last char of the last token preceding the
declaration.  See the comment blurb at the start of cc-engine.el for
more info."
