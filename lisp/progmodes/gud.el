;;; Commentary:

;; The ancestral gdb.el was by W. Schelter <wfs@rascal.ics.utexas.edu>.
;; It was later rewritten by rms.  Some ideas were due to Masanobu.  Grand
;; Unification (sdb/dbx support) by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com> Barry
;; Warsaw <bwarsaw@cen.com> hacked the mode to use comint.el.  Shane Hartman
;; <shane@spr.com> added support for xdb (HPUX debugger).  Rick Sladkey
;; <jrs@world.std.com> wrote the GDB command completion code.  Dave Love
;; <d.love@dl.ac.uk> added the IRIX kluge, re-implemented the Mips-ish variant
;; and added a menu. Brian D. Carlstrom <bdc@ai.mit.edu> combined the IRIX
;; kluge with the gud-xdb-directories hack producing gud-dbx-directories.
;; Derek L. Davies <ddavies@world.std.com> added support for jdb (Java
;; debugger.)

;; command definition

;; This macro is used below to define some basic debugger interface commands.
;; Of course you may use `gud-def' with any other debugger command, including
;; user defined ones.

;; A macro call like (gud-def FUNC CMD KEY DOC) expands to a form
;; which defines FUNC to send the command CMD to the debugger, gives
;; it the docstring DOC, and binds that function to KEY in the GUD
;; major mode.  The function is also bound in the global keymap with the
;; GUD prefix.

(defmacro gud-def (func cmd key &optional doc)
  "Define FUNC to be a command sending CMD and bound to KEY, with
optional doc string DOC.  Certain %-escapes in the string arguments
are interpreted specially if present.  These are:

  %f -- Name (without directory) of current source file.
  %F -- Name (without directory or extension) of current source file.
  %d -- Directory of current source file.
  %l -- Number of current source line.
  %e -- Text of the C lvalue or function-call expression surrounding point.
  %a -- Text of the hexadecimal address surrounding point.
  %p -- Prefix argument to the command (if any) as a number.
  %c -- Fully qualified class name derived from the expression
        surrounding point (jdb only).

  The `current' source file is the file of the current buffer (if
we're in a C file) or the source file current at the last break or
step (if we're in the GUD buffer).
  The `current' line is that of the current buffer (if we're in a
source file) or the source line number at the last break or step (if
we're in the GUD buffer)."

;; All debugger-specific information is collected here.
;; Here's how it works, in case you ever need to add a debugger to the mode.
;;
;; Each entry must define the following at startup:
;;
;;<name>
;; comint-prompt-regexp
;; gud-<name>-massage-args
;; gud-<name>-marker-filter
;; gud-<name>-find-file
;;
;; The job of the massage-args method is to modify the given list of
;; debugger arguments before running the debugger.
;;
;; The job of the marker-filter method is to detect file/line markers in
;; strings and set the global gud-last-frame to indicate what display
;; action (if any) should be triggered by the marker.  Note that only
;; whatever the method *returns* is displayed in the buffer; thus, you
;; can filter the debugger's output, interpreting some and passing on
;; the rest.
;;
;; The job of the find-file method is to visit and return the buffer indicated
;; by the car of gud-tag-frame.  This may be a file name, a tag name, or
;; something else.

;; CREATED:	Sun Feb 22 10:46:38 1998 Derek Davies.
;; UPDATED:	Nov 11, 2001 Zoltan Kemenczy
;;              Dec 10, 2002 Zoltan Kemenczy - added nested class support
;;
;; INVOCATION NOTES:
;;
;; You invoke jdb-mode with:
;;
;;    M-x jdb <enter>
;;
;; It responds with:
;;
;;    Run jdb (like this): jdb
;;
;; type any jdb switches followed by the name of the class you'd like to debug.
;; Supply a fully qualified classname (these don't have the ".class" extension)
;; for the name of the class to debug (e.g. "COM.the-kind.ddavies.CoolClass").
;; See the known problems section below for restrictions when specifying jdb
;; command line switches (search forward for '-classpath').
;;
;; You should see something like the following:
;;
;;    Current directory is ~/src/java/hello/
;;    Initializing jdb...
;;    0xed2f6628:class(hello)
;;    >
;;
;; To set an initial breakpoint try:
;;
;;    > stop in hello.main
;;    Breakpoint set in hello.main
;;    >
;;
;; To execute the program type:
;;
;;    > run
;;    run hello
;;
;;    Breakpoint hit: running ...
;;    hello.main (hello:12)
;;
;; Type M-n to step over the current line and M-s to step into it.  That,
;; along with the JDB 'help' command should get you started.  The 'quit'
;; JDB command will get out out of the debugger.  There is some truly
;; pathetic JDB documentation available at:
;;
;;     http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/debugging/
;;
;; KNOWN PROBLEMS AND FIXME's:
;;
;; Not sure what happens with inner classes ... haven't tried them.
;;
;; Does not grok UNICODE id's.  Only ASCII id's are supported.
;;
;; You must not put whitespace between "-classpath" and the path to
;; search for java classes even though it is required when invoking jdb
;; from the command line.  See gud-jdb-massage-args for details.
;; The same applies for "-sourcepath".
;;
;; Note: The following applies only if `gud-jdb-use-classpath' is nil;
;; refer to the documentation of `gud-jdb-use-classpath' and
;; `gud-jdb-classpath',`gud-jdb-sourcepath' variables for information
;; on using the classpath for locating java source files.
;;
;; If any of the source files in the directories listed in
;; gud-jdb-directories won't parse you'll have problems.  Make sure
;; every file ending in ".java" in these directories parses without error.
;;
;; All the .java files in the directories in gud-jdb-directories are
;; syntactically analyzed each time gud jdb is invoked.  It would be
;; nice to keep as much information as possible between runs.  It would
;; be really nice to analyze the files only as necessary (when the
;; source needs to be displayed.)  I'm not sure to what extent the former
;; can be accomplished and I'm not sure the latter can be done at all
;; since I don't know of any general way to tell which .class files are
;; defined by which .java file without analyzing all the .java files.
;; If anyone knows why JavaSoft didn't put the source file names in
;; debuggable .class files please clue me in so I find something else
;; to be spiteful and bitter about.

;; When we send a command to the debugger via gud-call, it's annoying
;; to see the command and the new prompt inserted into the debugger's
;; buffer; we have other ways of knowing the command has completed.
;;
;; If the buffer looks like this:
;; --------------------
;; (gdb) set args foo bar
;; (gdb) -!-
;; --------------------
;; (the -!- marks the location of point), and we type `C-x SPC' in a
;; source file to set a breakpoint, we want the buffer to end up like
;; this:
;; --------------------
;; (gdb) set args foo bar
;; Breakpoint 1 at 0x92: file make-docfile.c, line 49.
;; (gdb) -!-
;; --------------------
;; Essentially, the old prompt is deleted, and the command's output
;; and the new prompt take its place.
;;
;; Not echoing the command is easy enough; you send it directly using
;; process-send-string, and it never enters the buffer.  However,
;; getting rid of the old prompt is trickier; you don't want to do it
;; when you send the command, since that will result in an annoying
;; flicker as the prompt is deleted, redisplay occurs while Emacs
;; waits for a response from the debugger, and the new prompt is
;; inserted.  Instead, we'll wait until we actually get some output
;; from the subprocess before we delete the prompt.  If the command
;; produced no output other than a new prompt, that prompt will most
;; likely be in the first chunk of output received, so we will delete
;; the prompt and then replace it with an identical one.  If the
;; command produces output, the prompt is moving anyway, so the
;; flicker won't be annoying.
;;
;; So - when we want to delete the prompt upon receipt of the next
;; chunk of debugger output, we position gud-delete-prompt-marker at
;; the start of the prompt; the process filter will notice this, and
;; delete all text between it and the process output marker.  If
;; gud-delete-prompt-marker points nowhere, we leave the current
;; prompt alone.

(define-derived-mode gud-mode comint-mode "Debugger"
  "Major mode for interacting with an inferior debugger process.

   You start it up with one of the commands M-x gdb, M-x sdb, M-x dbx,
M-x perldb, M-x xdb, or M-x jdb.  Each entry point finishes by executing a
hook; `gdb-mode-hook', `sdb-mode-hook', `dbx-mode-hook',
`perldb-mode-hook', `xdb-mode-hook', or `jdb-mode-hook' respectively.

After startup, the following commands are available in both the GUD
interaction buffer and any source buffer GUD visits due to a breakpoint stop
or step operation:

\\[gud-break] sets a breakpoint at the current file and line.  In the
GUD buffer, the current file and line are those of the last breakpoint or
step.  In a source buffer, they are the buffer's file and current line.

\\[gud-remove] removes breakpoints on the current file and line.

\\[gud-refresh] displays in the source window the last line referred to
in the gud buffer.

\\[gud-step], \\[gud-next], and \\[gud-stepi] do a step-one-line,
step-one-line (not entering function calls), and step-one-instruction
and then update the source window with the current file and position.
\\[gud-cont] continues execution.

\\[gud-print] tries to find the largest C lvalue or function-call expression
around point, and sends it to the debugger for value display.

The above commands are common to all supported debuggers except xdb which
does not support stepping instructions.

Under gdb, sdb and xdb, \\[gud-tbreak] behaves exactly like \\[gud-break],
except that the breakpoint is temporary; that is, it is removed when
execution stops on it.

Under gdb, dbx, and xdb, \\[gud-up] pops up through an enclosing stack
frame.  \\[gud-down] drops back down through one.

If you are using gdb or xdb, \\[gud-finish] runs execution to the return from
the current function and stops.

All the keystrokes above are accessible in the GUD buffer
with the prefix C-c, and in all buffers through the prefix C-x C-a.

All pre-defined functions for which the concept make sense repeat
themselves the appropriate number of times if you give a prefix
argument.

You may use the `gud-def' macro in the initialization hook to define other
commands.

Other commands for interacting with the debugger process are inherited from
comint mode, which see."
