;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file implements links to database entries in BibTeX files.
;; Instead of defining a special link prefix, it uses the normal file
;; links combined with a custom search mechanism to find entries
;; by reference key.  And it constructs a nice description tag for
;; the link that contains the author name, the year and a short title.
;;
;; It also stores detailed information about the entry so that
;; remember templates can access and enter this information easily.
;;
;; The available properties for each entry are listed here:
;;
;; :author        :publisher      :volume      :pages
;; :editor        :url            :number      :journal
;; :title         :year           :series      :address
;; :booktitle     :month          :annote      :abstract
;; :key           :btype
;;
;; Here is an example of a remember template that use some of this
;; information (:author :year :title :journal :pages):
;;
;; (setq org-remember-templates
;;   '((?b "* READ %?\n\n%a\n\n%:author (%:year): %:title\n   \
;;          In %:journal, %:pages.")))
;;
;; Let's say you want to remember this BibTeX entry:
;;
;; @Article{dolev83,
;;   author = 	 {Danny Dolev and Andrew C. Yao},
;;   title = 	 {On the security of public-key protocols},
;;   journal = 	 {IEEE Transaction on Information Theory},
;;   year = 	 1983,
;;   volume =	 2,
;;   number =	 29,
;;   pages =	 {198--208},
;;   month =	 {Mars}
;; }
;;
;; M-x `org-remember' on this entry will produce this buffer:
;;
;; =====================================================================
;; * READ <== [point here]
;;
;; [[file:file.bib::dolev83][Dolev & Yao 1983: security of public key protocols]]
;;
;; Danny Dolev and Andrew C. Yao (1983): On the security of public-key protocols
;; In IEEE Transaction on Information Theory, 198--208.
;; =====================================================================
;;
;; Additionally, the following functions are now available for storing
;; bibtex entries within Org-mode documents.
;;
;; - Run `org-bibtex' to export the current file to a .bib.
;;
;; - Run `org-bibtex-check' or `org-bibtex-check-all' to check and
;;   fill in missing field of either the current, or all headlines
;;
;; - Run `org-bibtex-create' to add a bibtex entry
;;
;; - Use `org-bibtex-read' to read a bibtex entry after `point' or in
;;   the active region, then call `org-bibtex-write' in a .org file to
;;   insert a heading for the read bibtex entry
;;
;; - All Bibtex information is taken from the document compiled by
;;   Andrew Roberts from the Bibtex manual, available at
;;   http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/sessions/bibtex/bibentries.pdf
;;
;;; History:
;;
;; The link creation part has been part of Org-mode for a long time.
;;
;; Creating better remember template information was inspired by a request
;; of Austin Frank: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/4112
;; and then implemented by Bastien Guerry.
;;
;; Eric Schulte eventually added the functions for translating between
;; Org-mode headlines and Bibtex entries, and for fleshing out the Bibtex
;; fields of existing Org-mode headlines.
;;
;; Org-mode loads this module by default - if this is not what you want,
;; configure the variable `org-modules'.
