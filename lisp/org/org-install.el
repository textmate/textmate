;;; Commentary:
;;
;; When Org-mode is distributed with Emacs, this is just a dummy file.
;; In an Org-mode distribution outside Emacs, this file would provide
;; the autoloads.  We include this dummy version in Emacs, so that people
;; can leave a (require 'org-install) in .emacs, independently of
;; which kind of distribution they use.

(provide 'org-install)
