1985-07-12  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* mh-e.el:
	Replace C-h command with DEL so Help is still available.
	get-string was erroneously used for read-string.

1985-07-10  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	Don't call substitute-command-keys if keybindings are default,
	with resultant couple-of-orders-of-magnitude speedup.
	RMS: this is what my changes to Fsubstitute_command_keys in doc.c
	were supposed to do.

	* dired.el (dired-revert):
	Avoid error if point is at a non-file line.

	* abbrev.el (expand-region-abbrevs):
	Record end of region as distance from dot-max, so it
	remains correct as abbrevs are expanded.

	* startup.el (command-line-1):
	Quote the backslash in the regexp for line-number specs.

1985-07-02  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* shell.el:
	Create variable explicit-shell-file-name that overrides

	Define comment-start-skip so it does not match the null string.

	* c-mode.el (electric-c-terminator):
	Don't use find-line-comment--use parse-partial-sexp to
	check for line ending in a comment.

	* startup.el (command-line-1):
	Define +nnn line-number specs.
	Use precomputed help string for speed instead of
	substitute-command-keys when the precomputed string is correct.

1985-06-16  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

1985-06-15  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* simple.el, lisp-mode.el, c-mode.el, scheme.el:
	comment-indent-hook now called with no args, with point
	at beginning of existing comment or at end of line.
	mim-mode's comment-indent-hook seems to need no change.

1985-06-14  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* loaddefs.el (rmail-dont-reply-to-names):
	Misleading documentation said `list' of names.  Its really a
	regular expression.  Make it nil by default.  Also, add defconst
	for `rmail-spool-directory'.

	* mail-utils.el (rmail-dont-reply-to):
	Check for nilness of rmail-dont-reply-to-names and skip strip
	loop if so.

	* loaddefs.el: Elisp -> Emacs-Lisp.

	* echistory.el, chistory.el: Elisp -> Emacs-Lisp.

	* rmail.el:
	Various functions - If message counters aren't set, set them.
	Expunge unsets them.  Make expunge give running count in
	minibuffer messages.

1985-06-14  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* lisp-mode.el, startup.el, loadup.el:
	Avoid problem with term "elisp".

	rename all other elisp-FOO to emacs-lisp-FOO.

1985-06-14  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* rmail.el (rmail-mode-1):
	Use %b instead of %17b in mode-line-format to leave more room for
	attributes (some of us like time in the modeline).

	* rmail.el:
	Make rmail-summary-goto-msg barf if the summary is invalid (e.g.
	after `e' or `g') and tell user to make a new one, leaving them in
	the rmail window which is right place to do it.

	* rmail.el:
	Add commands for user to set attributes.  rlk called these
	keywords and duplicated code (the only `attributes' were
	"deleted" and "answered").  I don't think the distinction is worth
	it.  Add command for summarizing by attribute.  Make
	`rmail-new-summary' support it.

	* rmail.el (rmail-show-message): search instead of re-search.

	* rmail.el (rmail-output-to-mail-file): Yechh.  Cleaned it up.

	* rmail.el (rmail-summary-mode):
	Add functions for scrolling current message from summary.  After
	rlk, only make them bullet proof.  Add quit from rmail.

	* rmail.el (rmail-new-summary):
	Reuse old summary buffers when possible.  After rlk, only his way
	of doing it was brain damaged.

	* rmail.el:
	rmail-last-message was off by 1.  Fix it and put it on key `>'.
	(bug noted by rlk).  Make rmail-edit run text-mode-hook.  rlk also
	had it run `rmail-edit-mode-hook' but this is silly because function
	claims to be like text-mode except for two keys.

	* rmail.el (rmail-insert-inbox-text):
	Chomper wasn't deleting ~/.newmail after moving mail from
	/usr/spool/mail/.  Make it do the right thing.  Use new variable
	rmail-spool-directory (default "/usr/spool/mail/") to determine
	if movemail should be called (some people use "/spool/mail/").
	Probably should move defvar to loaddefs when released.

	* simple.el: Flush `blink-matching-paren-ding' and code.

	* add-log.el: Flush `add-log-entry-to-log-in-buffer'.

	* loaddefs.el:
	Changes to reflect partitioning of command history stuff.
	Flush autoload of report-emacs-bug, leave the file emacsbug.el for
	arpanet sites to use if they want.

	* echistory.el: (require 'chistory)

	* chistory.el:
	Move list-command-history and command-history-mode here.  Purpose
	of this file is just to look at the history.  Also contains
	unrelated (to listing) but useful `repeat-matching-complex-command'.

	* simple.el (repeat-complex-command):
	Replaced its definition with `repeat-edit-nth-complex-command' from
	chistory.el, edit form in minibuffer instead of asking for
	confirmation.  Add new function `edit-and-eval-command' which it
	uses.

1985-06-13  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* rmail.el (rmail-insert-inbox-text):
	Expand file name "movemail" in exec-directory for call-process.
	The only reason it worked here before is because exec-directory is
	in most people's shell paths.
	No, this directory is added automatically to the path
	used by call-process.  It should have worked before. - RMS

	* loaddefs.el: C-z -> C-c in documentation for mail.
	autoload report-emacs-bug from emacsbug.el.

	* emacsbug.el: New file.  Reports bugs with version info.

	* helper.el (Helper-describe-bindings):
	Make it describe local bindings faster by binding global map to
	nil so describe-bindings is faked out.

	* lisp-mode.el: First form of prog1 is distinguished.

	* loaddefs.el: Autoload functions from chistory.el and echistory.el.

	* chistory.el:
	New file containing two alternatives to `repeat-complex-command'
	which put the form in the minibuffer instead of asking for
	confirmation.

	* echistory.el:
	Finished it.  Split off two useful but unrelated commands into
	chistory.el.  Made command-history-mode unable to redo expressions
	because there is no sensible way to pick buffer to do it in: now
	its just for looking at the history produced by
	list-command-history or after electric-command-history throws.

	* electric.el: Allow specification of prompt to
	Electric-command-loop.  Interpret nil max-height argument to
	Electric-pop-up-window as license to grab as much of the screen as
	necessary if buffer won't fit; also fix fencepost neglect to
	account for modeline in height computations.

1985-06-12  Richard Mlynarik  (mly@mit-prep)

	* rmail (rmail-insert-inbox-text):
	file-name-directory includes a trailing "/".

1985-06-12  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* shell.el (inferior-lisp-mode):
	Call lisp-mode-hook AFTER shell-mode-hook.

	* rmail.el (rmail-get-attribute-string):
	Did not account for empty attribute string.  Neglected to include
	leading `,' for rmail-display-message-attributes.  Unbound
	variable dot-max-save - I guessed that it was really supposed to
	be dot-min before the widen (the start of the user visible header)
	so I bound it and renamed it dot-min-save.

	* ebuff-menu.el:
	New variable  after-electric-buffer-menu  called after select if
	non-nil.  Bind goal-column to nil while running.

	* add-log.el:
	New function  add-log-entry-to-log-in-buffer.  Use when adding
	multiple entries to the ChangeLog.  Bound to ESC-*.  Made it share
	code with add-change-log-entry (former calls latter).

1985-06-12  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* rmail.el (rmail-get-attribute-string):
	Rewritten by rlk to be smaller and more general.

1985-06-11  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* ebuff-menu.el: Make M-C-v scroll-other-window instead of
	scroll-down.  Make M-v scroll-down.

	* ebuff-menu.el, echistory.el: Made them use electric.

	* electric.el:
	New module for packages that retain control until some event
	occurs.  Command loop and window maker.

1985-06-10  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* echistory.el:
	Made it use helper.el.  Remove kill-ring-save stuff pending use of
	new winning prin1-to-string for minibuffer hacking.

	* view.el: Made it use helper.el.

	* helper.el:
	New module for packages which want to do help without giving up
	control.

1985-06-10  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* sendmail.el:
	Switch to C-c as prefix instead of C-z.

1985-06-09  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* simple.el:
	Rename kill-ring-save to copy-region-as-kill.
	Old name still works.

	* tags.el (visit-tag-table-buffer):
	Give error unless tag table starts with a formfeed
	as it should.

	* sendmail.el:
	Install C-z w as mail-signature.
	Fix bug of reinserting --text...-- in wrong place
	when a null subject was deleted.

	* macros.el (kbd-macro-query):
	Don't ask for input when macro is being defined.
	When macro is executing, make prompt really appear.
	In loaddefs, put this on C-x q.

1985-06-09  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* dired.el:
	Fix bugs in dired introduced by use of auto-save-file-name-p.  Don't
	call it if it isn't fbound (just look for `#').  Add second arg to
	dired-get-filename which says just return nil (no error) if there
	is no filename on line.  Rename dired-mark-backup-and-temp-files
	to be dired-mark-backup-and-auto-save-files.

1985-06-08  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* ebuff-menu.el (electric-buffer-list):
	Lost if # lines < window-min-height and there was only one window.
	Make it win!

	* echistory.el:
	New file - implements command history interface (electric and
	plain jane listing).  Waiting for opinions before I put it in
	loaddefs.

	* ebuff-menu.el (electric-buffer-list):
	Went to char select after Buffer-menu-execute, which can kill
	lines.  So set mark at select before execute and go to mark before
	select.  Winnage.

	* buff-menu.el:
	Stomp all kinds of roaches.  Buffer-menu-do-kills was doing re-search
	when it wanted to do search (no harm, but faster).  Fix fencepost
	error, when it killed a buffer line, it neglected to move back,
	thereby sitting on potential `K' which was missed. Wrap
	save-excursion around kill-buffer, it seems that kill-buffer changes
	something when it asks about mod file (don't ask me ...).
	Buffer-menu-do-saves was searching for "\n.S", it meant re-search.
	Teach Buffer-menu-unmark how to handle `%' and `*' at same time.

	* files.el (find-file-no-select):
	Don't run dired if value of new variable  find-file-run-dired  is
	nil.  t by default.

1985-06-07  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* options.el (list-options): Use substitute-command-keys.

	* loaddefs.el (view-file, view-buffer, electric-buffer-list):
	Mention view-hook.  Mention electric-buffer-menu-mode-hook.

	* ebuff-menu.el:
	Restrict dot to actual buffer description line.  Document some
	functions.  Make electric-buffer-menu-describe-mode interactive.
	Make C-g shutup when it exits, advertise it as exit char.
	Restrict help so that window configuration lossage is impossible
	(could lose if went into full blown help).  Add function for
	describing help options.  Add `v' command for viewing buffer and
	returning to the Electric Buffer List.

	* loaddefs.el: Autoload edit-picture.

	* picture.el: New "Major" mode for editing pictures and tables.

	* view.el:
	Fix bug with non-file-buffer names.  Use buffer name instead in
	these cases.  New variable view-hook.

1985-06-06  Richard Mlynarik  (mly@mit-prep)

	* view.el:
	(provide 'view)
	defined unadvertised c-m-a, c-m-e, c-m-b, c-m-f
	at end of buffer says how to exit.

1985-06-06  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* view.el:
	Restrict quit to q, C-c, C-z.  Fill keymaps with new function
	view-undefined which dings and tells you how to quit or get help.
	Add eval-expression but don't advertise it.

	* indent.el (edit-tab-stops-note-changes):
	Make *Tab Stops* buffer go away when changes are installed by
	switching to edit-tab-stops-buffer and burying *Tab Stops*.

1985-06-06  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* fill.el:
	New function fill-individual-paragraphs.

	* dired.el:
	Rename dired-mark-temp-files to dired-mark-auto-save-files,
	and make it use auto-save-file-name-p.

	* bytecode.el (byte-recompile-directory):
	Use auto-save-file-name-p.  Provide default definition of same.

	* files.el:
	Define auto-save-file-name-p.

1985-06-04  Richard Mlynarik  (mly@mit-prep)

	* sendmail.el (sendmail-send-it):
	Somewhat gratuitously deleting empty subject lines.
	/usr/lib/sendmail seems smart enough (!) to hack this itself.

1985-06-04  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* info.el (Info-find-node, Info-exit):
	Use expansion of filename in error message on file not found in
	Info-find-node.  Bury the current buffer in Info-exit because you
	can say C-h i if you want to look at it again.

	* simple.el (goal-column):
	Use \\[...] to refer to set-goal-column in variable documentation.

	* simple.el (function-called-at-dot, variable-at-dot):
	Eliminate redundant testing of nil'ness of obj in and clauses.

	* simple.el (describe-variable):
	Bind enable-recursive-minibuffers so can use C-h v.  It would be
	nice if instead could enable JUST C-h v (or C-h f for
	describe-function).

	* aton.el (occur-menu):
	Bogus message in minibuffer claimed C-z expanded menu entry.
	Use substitute-command-keys to get the right key.  Move to the
	first line if rebuild-summary, else the next line.  Make the
	occur menu buffer read-only.

1985-06-03  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* mim-mode.el:
	Fix bugs related to moving across atoms in other packages (i.e.
	with trailers).

1985-06-03  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* c-mode.el (indent-c-exp, calculate-c-indent):
	Fix indentation of line following a #-directive in C-M-Q,
	by doing essentially what calculate-c-indent does.
	New subroutine c-backward-to-start-of-if.

	* isearch.el:
	Don't allow reverse search to match a string straddling the
	initial value of dot.

	* simple.el (read-quoted-char):
	Handle quitting correctly (really quit unless first input char).
	Echo with spaces between chars and dash after
	even if have prompt string.

1985-06-03  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* mim-mode.el, medit.el:
	Clean up the documentation, use \\[...] where appropriate.

	* loaddefs.el: Update documentation for rmail.

	* lisp-mode.el (calculate-lisp-indent):

	* scheme-mode.el (calculate-scheme-indent): Ditto.

	* compile.el (next-error): Missed a \\[...].

	* buff-menu.el:
	Use \\[...].  Disambiguate documentation of q command (read as if
	you marked buffers with > instead of m, now mention mark `>' and
	what command you use to make one).

	Still failed to terminate in some cases (after many #include's and
	#defines, comments at beginning of file).  Now stop if looking at #

	at right place for indenter?

1985-05-31  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* simple.el (help-for-help):
	Lookup in help-map explicitly; calling help-command no longer works.

	Make it interactive since it's on a key.  Also, indent lambda like
	defun.

	* view.el:

	line (useful in conjunction with recenter and argument).  Flush
	repeat last command because it really does not repeat all commands.

1985-05-29  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* rmail.el:
	Add C-r command (rmail-edit-current-message) and its commands.
	Separated out part of rmail-mode as rmail-mode-1.

	* Rename some files so all .el & .elc file names are <= 14 chars.

	new-version-level.el => grow-vers.el.
	scheme-mode.el => scheme.el.
	compare-windows.el => compare-w.el.
	electric-buffer-list.el => ebuff-menu.el.

1985-05-28  Richard Mlynarik  (mly@mit-prep)

	* simple.el (describe-function):
	Bind enable-recursive-minibuffers to read fn name
	(useful when typing c-h f after m-esc).

	* files.el:
	Make create-file-buffer a lisp function (was in src/buffer.c).

	* electric-buffer-menu-mode.el:

	delete fill prefixes before checking for excess spaces.

1985-05-25  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* c-mode.el:
	c-backward-to-noncomment failed to terminate on LF after #include
	at beginning of buffer.  Make it stop if it sees bobp in such cases.

	* isearch.el:
	isearch was doing (push-mark odot) inside save-window-excursion,
	which loses.  Move to outside of save-window-excursion.

1985-05-23  Richard Mlynarik  (mly@mit-prep)

	was searching for "\n^L" not "\n\^L".

	* lisp-mode.el, loadup.el, startup.el:
	Rename lisp-interaction-mode to elisp-interaction-mode
	Make elisp-mode call elisp-mode-hook, elisp-interaction-mode call
	elisp-interaction-mode-hook.  This will break people's init files!

	* loaddefs.el:
	Make ".lisp" suffixes get lisp mode.  Toto, I don't think we're
	using fourteen-character filenames anymore.
	Autoload scheme-mode.

	* scheme-mode.el:
	Install scheme-mode, courtesy MIT scheme people.

	* lisp-mode.el:

1985-05-22  Richard Mlynarik  (mly@mit-prep)

	* nrnews.el:
	Foo.  A distinct lack of communication here.
	Fairly radical surgery --- many bug fixes and clarifications,
	quite different from rnews.el  Sigh

1985-05-22  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* view.el:
	Add new flavor of help.  ?, h still give list of
	commands.  C-h understands m, c, k options.  Make
	help commands use pop up window with scroll on space.

	* loaddefs.el:
	Minor change for documentation of view-file and
	view-buffer because C-h does not describe mode now.

1985-05-22  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* rnews.el:
	news-go-to-news-group: don't get confusing error if arg is nil.

	  Change so arg N means go forward N groups.
	  Don't print any messages.

	  Don't print any messages.
	news-move-to-message: simplify by using news-previous-group.
	  Also, most messages were spurious.
	news-goto-news-group: it had duplicate definitions.
	  Flushed both of them; use news-go-to-news-group instead.
	various: standardized ellipses in messages.
	  Use error rather than message where appropriate.

1985-05-21  Richard Mlynarik  (mly@mit-prep)

	* mlsupport.el:
	Fix assorted typos where variable "bufname" was changed to "name".

	* view.el:
	Make M-<, M-> work.  Fix documentation strings to work with the
	combination of lisp quoting and substitute-command-keys quoting.

	* electric-buffer-list.el:
	Call Buffer-menu-execute before selecting. (Why doesn't standard
	buffer-menu-mode do this?)  Flush "x", "1" and "2" commands.

	* buff-menu.el:
	Call bury-buffer after selecting new buffer.
	Make things work when  pop-up-windows  is nil.

1985-05-21  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* view.el:
	Flush skip commands since they don't make much sense.  Make searches,
	goto-line's center display at point found with dot at beginning of
	line.  Use mark ring and provide mark manipulation commands.  C-l
	is recenter.  Improve documentation.

1985-05-21  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* loadup.el:
	Copy DOCSTR rather than renaming it.

	* sendmail.el (mail-yank-original):

1985-05-20  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* rmail.el (rmail-get-new-mail):
	Pass the proper arg to delete-file.
	Don't always say "no new mail has arrived".

	* sendmail.el (mail-send-and-exit):
	Bury the *mail* buffer.

1985-05-19  Richard Mlynarik  (mly@mit-prep)

	* view.el, dired.el:
	Typos in viewing stuff.

	* simple.el, isearch.el:
	Add prompt argument to read-quoted-char; improve isearch
	input echoing when reading quoted char.

	* sendmail.el, loaddefs.el:
	Add send-mail-function; initially sendmail-send-it
	(also, mail-yank-ignored-headers had a typo).

	* rmail.el (rmail-get-new-mail, convert-to-babyl-format, ...):
	* loaddefs.el:
	Remodularize inbox parsing.  Add support(?) for mmdf inboxes.
	Note that I can't seem to define definitive documentation of
	what this format is; however the code installed seems to work
	for all cases encountered.

1985-05-19  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* rmail.el (rmail-get-new-mail):
	Pass the proper arg to delete-file.

	Get error if about to rename a directory.

1985-05-18  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* view.el, more-mode.el: Latter flushed in favor of former.
	view-mode preserves concept of more-mode but uses
	non-standard command loop so that viewed buffer is unchanged
	on exit from mode.

	* dired.el, loaddefs.el: Changed to use view.el.  Change
	documentation of dired-listing-switches to note importance of
	excluding 'F' option.

1985-05-17  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* isearch.el:

	Returns to dired when user quits more.

1985-05-16  Richard Mlynarik  (mly@mit-prep)

	* simple.el: Make <help> i run info.

	* Sundry changes to go with changes in src/fileio.c making
	copy-file, rename-file, add-name take an optional third argument.
	The only autoloaded system code this breaks is rmail ---
	a condition-case for wrong-number-of-arguments kludge was installed
	there in two places to make things work until everybody is running
	an emacs which takes the extra arg (marked "** KLUDGE **".) Remember
	to remove the kludge at that time!
	Mods to files.el, loadup.el, rmail.el.

	* Add autoloading function electric-buffer-list.

	* buff-menu.el: Make splitting screen between > 2 buffers work.

1985-05-16  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-prep)

	* dired.el: Put dired-rename-file, dired-copy file-on keys.  Make
	them change buffer if appropriate.  Put dired-mark-backup-files,
	dired-mark-temp-files on keys.  Eliminate possibility of looping
	at last line in dired-repeat-over-filenames.

1985-05-15  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-grape-nehi)

	* dired.el: Fix bug in dired-noselect which caused dired of / to
	get buffer name of /default/directory// with contents of /.

1985-05-13  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* isearch.el: Add crl's slow isearch code, plus changes:
	use variable isearch-slow-speed to control whether to use it.

	* loadup.el: Flush the "inc" switch.

	* inc-version.el: Kill Emacs at the end.

1985-05-13  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-ajax)

	* replace.el: Add ?^ to list of special characters in query
	replace loop so that replacing continues after moving back to
	previous.

	* add-log.el: Add prefix arg to add-change-log-entry so will
	prompt for information if desired.  If there is an entry for today,
	make sure login-name is same before using it, else make new entry.
	Use auto-fill-mode.

1985-05-12  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* lisp-mode.el: Defined lisp-mode-commands, lisp-mode-variables.
	Added external-lisp-mode.
	Made doc strings mention mode hook variables.

	* shell.el: Defined functions `lisp' and `inferior-lisp-mode'.
	Renamed shell-send-defun... to lisp-send-defun...
	and made them use process "lisp", buffer *lisp*.

	* text-mode.el: Made indented-text-mode not call text-mode.
	Made doc strings mention mode hook variables.

	* c-mode.el: Made doc strings mention mode hook variables.

	Change format used for change log entries.
	Select indented-text-mode for the change log file.

1985-05-12  K. Shane Hartman  (shane@mit-ajax)

	* simple.el: Suppress matching close paren if preceded
		by char syntax \.
	* mim-mode.el: Flush private paren blinker in favor of default.
	* add-log.el: Change mode-string to mode-name so reflected in
		mode-line.  change \\W to \\sW when looking for place to add.

1985-05-12  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* simple.el: Modified open-line to insert newlines before
		an existing one before dot.  This makes better redisplay.
	* dired.el: Installed Shane's changes that allow user to choose
		switches to use.

1985-05-11  Richard M. Stallman  (rms@mit-prep)

	* rmail.el: If given file name as argument,
		correctly displays one message of that file
		but does not try to get new mail.
	* simple.el: Fix what-line bug: line # too high by 1 if not at bol.
		Put in blink-matching-paren-distance,
		and check for wrong kinds of parens matching.
