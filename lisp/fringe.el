This variable can be nil (the default) meaning the fringes should have

the width of both left and right fringe (where 0 means no fringe), or
a cons cell where car indicates width of left fringe and cdr indicates
width of right fringe (where again 0 can be used to indicate no
fringe).
Note that the actual width may be rounded up to ensure that the sum of
the width of the left and right fringes is a multiple of the frame's
character width.  However, a fringe width of 0 is never rounded.
To set this variable in a Lisp program, use `set-fringe-mode' to make
it take real effect.
Setting the variable with a customization buffer also takes effect.

you can use the interactive function `set-fringe-style'."
