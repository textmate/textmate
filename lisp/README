This directory contains source code for the parts of Emacs that are
written in Emacs Lisp.  *.el files are Emacs Lisp source, and the
corresponding *.elc files are byte-compiled versions.  Byte-compiled
files are architecture-independent.

The term subdirectory contains Lisp files that customize Emacs for
certain terminal types.  When Emacs starts, it checks the TERM
environment variable to get the terminal type and loads
`term/${TERM}.el' if it exists.

The other subdirectories hold Lisp packages grouped by their general
purpose.
