2008-11-19  Andy Stewart  <lazycat.manatee@gmail.com>

	* erc.el (erc-header-line-uses-tabbar-p): New option that makes
	tabbar mode usable with ERC if set to non-nil.
	(erc-update-mode-line-buffer): Use it.

2008-11-19  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* erc-compat.el (help-function-arglist): Autoload it.

2008-10-03  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-dcc.el (english): Increase size heading by two places.
	(erc-dcc-byte-count): Move higher.
	(erc-dcc-do-LIST-command): Use erc-dcc-byte-count to get accurate
	count.  Coerce byte total to floating point before performing
	computation, otherwise division will truncate to 0.
	(erc-dcc-append-contents): Update erc-dcc-byte-count.
	(erc-dcc-get-filter): Don't update erc-dcc-byte-count, because
	that will give incorrect size totals.  Instead, figure out how
	much we have by summing byte count and current buffer size.
	(erc-dcc-get-sentinel): Don't update erc-dcc-byte-count.

2008-10-01  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-dcc.el (erc-pack-int): Make sure returned string is within 4
	bytes.  Always return a 4-byte string, so that we conform to the
	CTCP spec.
	(erc-most-positive-int-bytes): New constant representing the
	number of bytes that most-positive-fixnum can be stored in.
	(erc-most-positive-int-msb): New constant representing the
	contents of the most significant byte of most-positive-fixnum.
	(erc-unpack-int): Make sure that the integer we get back can be
	represented in Emacs.
	(erc-dcc-do-CLOSE-command): Update docstring.  Don't use the line
	variable.  Try to disambiguate between type and nick when only one
	is provided.  Validate both type and nick arguments.  Allow
	matching by just nick.
	(erc-dcc-append-contents): Set inhibit-read-only to t.  Prevent
	auto-compression from triggering when we write the contents to a
	file.
	(erc-dcc-get-file): Prevent auto-compression from triggering when
	we truncate a file.

2008-07-27  Dan Nicolaescu  <dann@ics.uci.edu>

	* erc.el: Remove code for Carbon.

2008-06-07  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* erc/erc-autoaway.el, erc/erc-ibuffer.el, erc/erc-menu.el:
	* erc/erc-stamp.el, erc/erc.el: Remove unnecessary eval-when-compiles.

2008-05-30  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-backend.el (328): New response handler.

	* erc.el (english): Add 328 to catalog.

2008-05-29  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-services.el (erc-nickserv-alist): Update REGEXP and
	SUCCESS-REGEXP for freenode.

2008-05-05  Juanma Barranquero  <lekktu@gmail.com>

	* erc-goodies.el (erc-noncommands-list, noncommands)
	(erc-control-characters, erc-interpret-controls-p)
	(erc-interpret-mirc-color): Fix typos in docstrings.
	(erc-controls-highlight): Reflow docstring.

2008-04-26  Johan Bockgård  <bojohan@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-put-text-properties): Don't use mapcar*.
	(erc-display-line-1): Fix argument order in call to
	erc-put-text-properties.

2008-04-14  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-remove-text-properties-region): Disable this command
	by default.  Thanks to e1f for the suggestion.

2008-02-20  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-notice-face): Fix this face for Emacs 21 users.

2008-02-05  Juanma Barranquero  <lekktu@gmail.com>

	* erc-button.el (erc-button-syntax-table):
	* erc-match.el (erc-match-syntax-table): Replace `legal' with `valid'.

2008-02-04  Jeremy Maitin-Shepard  <jbms@cmu.edu>

	* erc.el (erc-cmd-QUERY): Bind the value of `erc-auto-query' to
	`erc-query-display' rather than `erc-join-buffer'.  This fixes a
	bug where the value of erc-auto-query was being ignored.

2008-01-31  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-dcc.el (erc-dcc-do-GET-command, erc-dcc-do-SEND-command):
	Improve docstring.  If FILE argument is split into multiple
	arguments, re-join them into a single string, separated by a
	space.  This fixes an issue where the user wants to send or
	receive a file with spaces in its name.  It is assumed that no one
	will try sending or receiving a file with multiple consecutive
	spaces in its name, otherwise this fix will fail.

	* erc.el (erc-mode-map): Add binding for C-c C-x to
	erc-quit-server, since rcirc.el binds its quit command in a
	similar manner.  Thanks to Jari Aalto for the suggestion.

2008-01-28  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-list-old.el (list-old): Define module as list-old, not list.
	This fixes a bug where an unknown module error would occur when
	starting ERC and using the list-old module.

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-find-face): If no choice was found
	return nil to use the default mode-line faces.

2008-01-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-version-string): Release ERC 5.3.

	* Makefile (VERSION): Update.
	(EXTRAS): Remove erc-list.el after all, because this is mainly for
	users of the version that comes with Emacs, and they will have
	erc-list.el by Emacs 23.
	(MISC): Add ChangeLog.07.
	(elpa): Fix build issue.  Add proper version to erc-pkg.el.

	* README.extras: Mention Emacs 23.

	* erc-pkg.el: Make the version string a template.

	* erc.texi (Obtaining ERC): Update extras URLs for 5.3.
	(Development): Write instructions for git, and remove those for Arch.
	(History): Mention the switch to git.

2008-01-25  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Update.

	* erc-goodies.el (keep-place): New module which keeps your place
	in unvisited ERC buffers when new messages arrive.  This is mostly
	taken from Johan Bockgård's init file.
	(erc-noncommands-list): Move to correct place.

	* erc-networks.el: Add a module definition.

	* erc-services.el (erc-nickserv-identify-mode): Force-enable the
	networks module, because we need it to set erc-network for us.

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-faces-normal-list): Indicate in the
	docstring that this variable can be set to nil.

	* erc.el: On second thought, don't load erc-networks.  Just enable
	the networks module by default.
	(erc-modules): Add option for keep-place and networks.  Enable
	networks by default.
	(erc-version-string): Make release candidate 1 available.

2008-01-24  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el: Load erc-networks.el so that functions get access to the
	`erc-network-name' function.

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-faces-normal-list): Add
	erc-dangerous-host-face.
	(erc-track-exclude-types): Add 333 and 353 to the default list of
	things to ignore, and explain what they are in the docstring.

2008-01-23  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-faces-priority-list): Move
	erc-nick-default-face higher, so that it can be used for the
	activity indication effect.  Add erc-current-nick-face,
	erc-pal-face, erc-dangerous-host-face, and erc-fool-face by
	themselves.
	(erc-track-faces-normal-list): New option that contains a list of
	faces to consider "normal".
	(erc-track-position-in-mode-line): Minor docfix.
	(erc-track-find-face): Use erc-track-faces-normal-list to produce
	a sort of blinking activity effect.

2008-01-22  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-button.el (erc-button-add-nickname-buttons): When in a
	channel buffer, only look at nicks from the current channel.
	Thanks to e1f for the report.

2008-01-21  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-compat.el (erc-const-expr-p, erc-list*, erc-assert): Remove,
	since we can use the default `assert' function without it causing
	us any problems, even in Emacs 21.  Thanks to bojohan for the
	suggestion.

	* erc-goodies.el (move-to-prompt): Use the "XEmacs" method
	instead, because the [remap ...] method interferes with
	delete-selection-mode.
	(erc-move-to-prompt): Rename from erc-move-to-prompt-xemacs.
	Deactivate mark and call push-mark before moving point.  Thanks to
	bojohan for the suggestion.
	(erc-move-to-prompt-setup): Rename from
	erc-move-to-prompt-init-xemacs.

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-faces-priority-list): Replace erc-button
	with '(erc-button erc-default-face) so that we only care about
	buttons that are part of normal text.  Adjust customization type
	to handle this case.  Make erc-nick-default-face a list.  Handle
	pals, fools, current nick, and dangerous hosts.
	(erc-track-find-face): Simplify.  Adapt for list of faces case.
	(erc-faces-in): Don't deflate lists of faces.  Add them as-is.
	(erc-track-face-priority): Use equal instead of eq.

2008-01-20  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-goodies.el (erc-move-to-prompt, erc-move-to-prompt-xemacs):
	Fix off-by-one error that caused the point to move when placed at
	the beginning of some already-typed text.  Thanks to e1f for the
	report.

	* erc.el (erc-modules): Add dcc and xdcc.

2008-01-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	in XEmacs 21.4 that throws an error when the first argument to
	run-at-time is nil.

	* erc-button.el (button): Undo XEmacs-specific change to all ERC
	buffers when module is removed.
	(erc-button-setup): Rename from erc-button-add-keys, and move
	XEmacs-specific stuff here.

	* erc-goodies.el (erc-unmorse): Improve regexp for detecting
	morse.  Deal with the morse style that has "/ " at the end of
	every letter.
	(erc-imenu-setup): New function that sets up Imenu support.  Add
	it instead of a lambda form to erc-mode-hook.
	(scrolltobottom): Remove erc-scroll-to-bottom from all ERC buffers
	when module is removed.  Activate the functionality in all ERC
	buffers when the module is activated, rather than leaving it up to
	the user.
	(move-to-prompt): New module that moves to the ERC prompt if a
	user tries to type elsewhere in the buffer, and then inserts their
	keystrokes there.  This is mostly taken from Johan Bockgård's init
	file.
	(erc-move-to-prompt): New function that implements this.
	(erc-move-to-prompt-xemacs): New function that implements this for
	XEmacs.
	(erc-move-to-prompt-init-xemacs): New function to perform the
	extra initialization step needed for XEmacs.

	* erc-page.el, erc-replace.el: Fix header and footer.

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-minor-mode-maybe): Take an optional
	buffer arg so that we can put this in erc-connect-pre-hook.  If
	given this argument, include it in the check to determine whether
	to activate erc-track-minor-mode.
	(track): Add erc-track-minor-mode-maybe to erc-connect-pre-hook,
	so that we can use it as soon as a connection is attempted.

	* erc.el (erc-format-network, erc-format-target-and/or-network):
	Use erc-network-name function instead, and check to see whether
	that function is bound.  This fixes an error in process filter for
	people who did not have erc-services or erc-networks loaded.
	(erc-modules): Add move-to-prompt module and enable it by
	default.  Thanks to e1f for the suggestion.

2008-01-18  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (EXTRAS): Include erc-list-old.el.

	* erc-dcc.el (erc-dcc-verbose): Rename from erc-verbose-dcc.
	(erc-pack-int): Rewrite to not depend on a count argument.
	(erc-unpack-int): Rewrite to remove 4-character limitation.
	(erc-dcc-server): Call set-process-coding-system and
	set-process-filter-multibyte so that the contents get sent out
	without modification.
	(erc-dcc-send-filter): Don't take a substring -- just pass the
	whole string to erc-unpack-int.
	(erc-dcc-receive-cache): New option that indicates the number of
	bytes to let the receive buffer grow before flushing it.
	(erc-dcc-file-name): New buffer-local variable to keep track of
	the filename of the currently-received file.
	(erc-dcc-get-file): Disable undo for a speed increase.  Set
	erc-dcc-file-name.  Truncate the file before writing to it.
	(erc-dcc-append-contents): New function to append the contents of
	a buffer to a file and then erase the contents of the buffer.
	(erc-dcc-get-filter): Flush buffer contents after exceeding
	erc-dcc-receive-cache.  This allows large files to be downloaded
	without storing the whole thing in memory.
	(erc-dcc-get-sentinel): Flush any remaining contents before
	closing.  No need to save buffer.
	(erc-dcc-listen-host): New option that determines which IP address
	to listen on.
	(erc-dcc-public-host): New option that determines which IP address
	to advertise when sending a file.  This is useful for people who
	are on a local subnet.  Together, these two options replace
	erc-dcc-host.

	* erc.el (erc-mode-line-format): Add %N and %S.  %N is the name of
	the network, and %S is much like %s but with the network name
	trumping the server name.  Default to "%S %a".  Thanks to e1f for
	the suggestion.
	(erc-format-network): New function that formats the network name.
	(erc-format-target-and/or-network): New function that formats both
	the network name and target, falling back on the server name if
	the network name is not available.
	(erc-update-mode-line-buffer): Add the new format spec items.

2008-01-17  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-join-buffer): Improve documentation.
	(erc-query-display): New option indicating how to display a query
	buffer that is made by using the /QUERY command.  The default is
	to display the query in a new window.
	(erc-cmd-QUERY): Use it.  Improve docstring.
	(erc-auto-query): Default this to 'window-noselect instead,
	because I've already seen bug reports about new users thinking
	that ERC didn't display their test messages.  Improve
	customization type.
	(erc-notice-face): Make this work with XEmacs.
	(erc-join-buffer): Mention 'buffer in docstring.  Improve
	customization type.

	* erc-dcc.el (erc-dcc-send-sentinel): Better handle case where elt
	is nil, in order to avoid an error.  Thanks to Brent Goodrick for
	the initial patch.
	(erc-dcc-display-send): New function split from erc-dcc-send-hook.
	(erc-dcc-send-connect-hook): Use it -- we don't like lambda forms
	in hooks.
	(erc-dcc-send-filter): Display byte count if the client confirmed
	too much, and kill the buffer.  Otherwise a DoS might be possible
	by making Emacs run out of RAM.

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-connect): Detect early on whether the
	connection attempt has failed in order to avoid confusing error
	messages.

	* erc-networks.el (erc-server-alist): Add Rizon network.

	* erc-services.el (erc-nickserv-passwords): Add Rizon to options.
	(erc-nickserv-alist): Add support for Rizon.

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-find-face): Don't let buttons in notices
	trump default text.  Use catch/throw.  Default to first element of
	FACES is nothing is found.

	* erc-xdcc.el: Add local variables for proper indentation setup.

2008-01-15  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-coding-system): Docfix.
	(erc-coding-system-for-target): Pass the `target' argument along
	as the first and only argument.  It's not good to just depend on a
	dynamic binding.

2008-01-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (321, 322): Split message-displaying parts into
	new functions, which are added to each response's respective
	hook.  This makes them easier to disable.

	* erc-list.el: New file from Tom Tromey.  Use erc-propertize
	instead of propertize.  Require 'erc.
	(list): New module definition.  Remove message-displaying
	functions for 321 and 322 response handlers when enabling the
	module, and restore them when disabling.  As a sanity check,
	remove the erc-list-handle-322 function when disabling the module.
	(erc-list-handle-322): Handle the case where we run the LIST
	command, but do not go through the normal steps.
	(erc-cmd-LIST): Add docstring.  Strip initial space from line if
	it is non-nil.  Use make-local-variable to silence compiler
	warning.  Capture current buffer and pass it to
	erc-list-install-322-handler.
	(erc-list-install-322-handler): Take server-buffer argument, so
	that we are certain of being in the right buffer.  Use 4th
	argument to add-hook, so that erc-server-322-functions is only
	modified in one buffer.

	* erc-list-old.el: Renamed from old erc-list.el.

	* erc.el (erc-modules): Add list-old.
	(erc-set-topic): Handle case where there are no newlines in the
	existing topic, which happens when /LIST is run.
	(erc-notice-face): If we have less than 88 colors, make this
	blue.  Otherwise the text will be pink in a tty, which looks
	dreadful.  Thanks to e1f for the report.
	(erc-remove-parsed-property): New option that determines whether
	to remove the erc-parsed property after displaying a message.
	This should have the effect of making ERC take up less memory.
	(erc-display-line-1): Use it.

2008-01-04  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* erc-ibuffer.el (erc-channel-modes):
	Pass mode-name through format-mode-line
