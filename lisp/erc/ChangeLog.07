2007-12-16  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-services.el (erc-nickserv-alist): Removed autodetect regexp,
	added identified regexp for OFTC.
	(erc-nickserv-identification-autodetect): Make sure success-regex
	is non-nil.
	(erc-nickserv-identify-autodetect): Make sure identify-regex is
	non-nil.  Doc fix.

2007-12-13  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-backend.el (PRIVMSG, QUIT, TOPIC, WALLOPS, 376, 004, 221)
	(312, 315, 319, 330, 331, 333, 367, 368, 391, 405, 406, 412)
	(421, 432, 433, 437, 442, 461, 474, 477, 482, 431): Doc fix.

2007-12-09  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-services.el (erc-nickserv-alist): Fix regexps for GRnet.

2007-12-09  Giorgos Keramidas  <keramida@ceid.upatras.gr>  (tiny change)

	* erc-backend.el, erc.el:
	Parse 275 (secure connection) responses.

	* erc-services.el: Add identification hooks for GRnet, the Greek
	IRC network <http://www.irc.gr>.

2007-12-08  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* erc-stamp.el (erc-echo-timestamp):
	* erc-lang.el (language):
	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-connect): Fix buggy call to `message'.

2007-12-07  Edward O'Connor  <ted@oconnor.cx>

	* erc-services.el: Provide a hook that runs when nickserv confirms
	that the user has successfully identified.
	(services, erc-nickserv-identify-mode): Add and remove
	erc-nickserv-identification-autodetect from
	erc-server-NOTICE-functions.
	(erc-nickserv-alist): Add SUCCESS-REGEXP to each entry.
	(erc-nickserv-alist-identified-regexp)
	(erc-nickserv-identification-autodetect): New functions.
	(erc-nickserv-identified-hook): New hook.

2007-12-06  Deepak Goel  <deego3@gmail.com>

	* erc-match.el (erc-add-entry-to-list): Fix buggy call to `error'.

2007-12-01  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-send-ping): Move after definition of
	erc-server-send.

2007-11-29  Giorgos Keramidas  <keramida@ceid.upatras.gr>  (tiny change)

	* erc-backend.el, erc.el:
	Parse 307 (nick has identified) responses.

2007-11-15  Juanma Barranquero  <lekktu@gmail.com>

	* erc.el (erc-open):
	* erc-backend.el (define-erc-response-handler):
	* erc-log.el (log):
	* erc-match.el (erc-log-matches): Fix typos in docstrings.

2007-11-11  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-autoaway.el (erc-autoaway-possibly-set-away):
	* erc-netsplit.el (erc-netsplit-timer):
	* erc-notify.el (erc-notify-timer):
	* erc-track.el (erc-user-is-active): Only run if we have
	successfully established a connection to the server and have
	logged in.  I suspect that sending messages too soon may make some
	IRC servers not respond well, particularly when the network
	connection is iffy or subject to traffic-shaping.

2007-11-01  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-compat.el (erc-set-write-file-functions): New compatibility
	function to set the write hooks appropriately.

	* erc-log.el (erc-log-setup-logging): Use
	erc-set-write-file-functions.  This fixes a byte-compiler warning.

	* erc-stamp.el: Silence byte-compiler warning about
	erc-fill-column.

	* erc.el (erc-with-all-buffers-of-server): Bind the result of
	mapcar to a variable in order to silence a byte-compiler warning.

2007-10-29  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-ibuffer.el (erc-modified-channels-alist): Use
	eval-when-compile, and explain why we are doing this.

2007-10-25  Dan Nicolaescu  <dann@ics.uci.edu>

	* erc-ibuffer.el (erc-modified-channels-alist): Pacify
	byte-compiler.

2007-10-13  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* erc-track.el (erc-modified-channels-update): Use mapc rather
	than mapcar.

2007-10-12  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc.el (erc-join-channel): Prompt for channel key if C-u or
	another prefix-arg was typed.

	* NEWS: Noted this change.

2007-10-07  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-cmd-ME'S): New command that handles the case where
	someone types "/me's".  It concatenates the text " 's" to the
	beginning of the input and then sends the result like a normal
	"/me" command.
	(erc-command-regexp): Permit single-quote character.

2007-09-30  Aidan Kehoe  <kehoea@parhasard.net>  (tiny change)

	* erc-log.el (erc-save-buffer-in-logs): Prevent spurious warnings
	when looking at a log file and concurrently saving to it.

2007-09-18  Exal de Jesus Garcia Carrillo  <exal@gnu.org>  (tiny change)

	* erc.texi (Special-Features): Fix small typo.

2007-09-16  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-switch-direction): Mention
	erc-track-faces-priority-list.  Thanks to Leo for the suggestion.

2007-09-11  Exal de Jesus Garcia Carrillo  <exal@gnu.org>  (tiny change)

	* erc-sound.el: Fix typo in setting up instructions.

2007-09-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (elpa): Copy dir template rather than echoing a few
	lines.  The reason for this is that the ELPA package for ERC was
	getting a corrupt dir entry.

	* dir-template: Template for the ELPA dir file.

2007-09-08  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-log.el (erc-log-filter-function): New option that specifies
	the function to call for filtering text before writing it to a log
	file.  Thanks to David O'Toole for the suggestion.
	(erc-save-buffer-in-logs): Use erc-log-filter-function.  Make sure
	we carry along the value of coding-system-for-write, because this
	could potentially be shadowed by the temporary buffer.

	* erc.el (erc-version-string): Update to 5.3, development version.

2007-09-07  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-toggle-debug-irc-protocol): Fix call to
	erc-view-mode-enter.

2007-08-08  Glenn Morris  <rgm@gnu.org>

	* erc-log.el, erc.el: Replace `iff' in doc-strings and comments.

2007-09-03  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-default-port): Make this an integer value rather
	than a string.  Thanks to Luca Capello for the report.

2007-08-27  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-cmd-GQUIT): If erc-kill-queries-on-quit is non-nil,
	kill all query buffers after 4 seconds.

2007-08-16  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Add ERC 5.3 changes section, and mention jbms' erc-track
	compatibility note.

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-list-changed-hook): Turn this into a
	customizable option.
	(erc-track-switch-direction): Add 'importance option.
	(erc-modified-channels-display): If erc-track-switch-direction is
	'importance, call erc-track-sort-by-importance.
	(erc-track-face-priority): New function that returns a number
	indicating the position of a face in erc-track-faces-priority-list.
	(erc-track-sort-by-importance): New function that sorts
	erc-modified-channels-list according to erc-track-face-priority.
	(erc-track-get-active-buffer): Make 'oldest a rough opposite of
	'importance.

2007-08-14  Jeremy Maitin-Shepard  <jbms@cmu.edu>

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-remove-disconnected-buffers): New
	variable which controls whether buffers associated with a server
	that is disconnected should be removed from
	`erc-modified-channels-alist'.  Existing behavior is to
	unconditionally remove such buffers, which is achieved by setting
	`erc-track-removed-disconnected-buffers' to t.  When set to t,
	which is the new default value, such buffers remain in the list,
	which I think is often the desired behavior, since the user may
	likely wish to find out about activity that occurred in a channel
	prior to it being disconnected.
	(erc-track-list-changed-hook): New hook that is run whenever the
	contents of `erc-modified-channels-alist' changes; it is useful
	for users such as myself that don't use the default mode-line
	notification but instead use a separate mechanism (which is tied
	to my window manager) to provide notification of channel activity.
	(erc-track-get-buffer-window): New function that acts as a wrapper
	around `get-buffer-window' that handles the `selected-visible'
	option of `erc-track-visibility'; previously, the value of
	`erc-track-visibility' was passed directly to `get-buffer-window',
	which does not support `selected-visible'; consequently,
	`selected-visible' was not properly supported.
	(erc-track-modified-channels): Fix a bug in the logic for removing
	buffers from the list in certain cases.
	(erc-track-position-in-mode-line): Add a supported value that
	specifies that the tracking information should not be added to the
	mode line at all.  The value of nil is used to indicate that the
	information should not be added at all to the mode line.
	(erc-track-add-to-mode-line): Check for position eq to t, rather
	than non-nil.
	(erc-buffer-visible): Use erc-track-get-buffer-window.
	(erc-modified-channels-update): Take
	erc-track-remove-disconnected-buffers into account.
	(erc-modified-channels-display): Run `erc-track-list-changed-hook'.

	* erc.el (erc-reuse-frames): New option that determines whether
	new frames are always created.  Defaults to t.  This only has an
	effect when erc-join-buffer is set to 'frame.
	(erc-setup-buffer): Use it.

2007-08-14  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-reconnect): If the server buffer has
	been killed, use the current buffer instead.  If the current
	buffer is not an ERC buffer, give an error.  This fixes a bug when
	/reconnect is run from a channel buffer whose server buffer has
	been deleted.  Thanks to jbms for the report.
	(erc-process-sentinel-1): Take server buffer as an argument, so
	that we can make sure that it is current.
	(erc-process-sentinel): Pass buffer to erc-process-sentinel-1.
	(erc-process-sentinel-2): New function split from
	erc-process-sentinel-1.  If server buffer is deleted during a
	reconnect attempt, stop trying to reconnect.  Fix bug where
	reconnect was not happening when erc-server-reconnect-attempts was
	t.  Call erc-server-reconnect-p only once each time.  If we are
	instructed to try connecting indefinitely, tell the user that they
	can stop this by killing the server buffer.  Call the process
	sentinel by means of run-at-time, so that there is time to kill
	the buffer if need be; this also removes the need for a while
	loop.  Refuse to reconnect again if erc-server-reconnect-timeout
	is not an number.

	* erc.el (erc-command-no-process-p): Fix bug: the return value of
	erc-extract-command-from-line is a list rather than a single
	symbol.  Thanks to jbms for the report.
	(erc-cmd-RECONNECT): Use simpler logic, and use buffer-live-p
	rather than bufferp.
	(erc-send-current-line, erc-display-command, erc-display-msg):
	Handle case where erc-server-process is nil, so that /reconnect
	works.

2007-08-12  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-identd.el (erc-identd-filter): Instead of sending an EOF
	character, which now confuses freenode, stop the server process,
	so that no new connections are accepted, and kill the current
	client process.

2007-07-29  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-list.el: Relicense to GPLv3.  Since the file was already
	licensed under version 2 or later, it turns out that we do not
	need the permission of all of the authors in order to proceed.

2007-07-13  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-goodies.el (erc-get-bg-color-face, erc-get-fg-color-face):
	Use erc-error rather than message and beep.

	* erc-sound.el: Indentation fix.

	* erc.el (erc-command-no-process-p): New function that determines
	if its argument is an ERC command that can be run when the server
	process is not alive.
	(erc-cmd-SET, erc-cmd-CLEAR, erc-cmd-COUNTRY, erc-cmd-HELP)
	(erc-cmd-LASTLOG, erc-cmd-QUIT, erc-cmd-GQUIT)
	(erc-cmd-RECONNECT, erc-cmd-SERVER): Denote that these commands
	can be run even when the server process is not alive.
	(erc-send-current-line): Call erc-command-no-process-p if the
	server process is not alive, to determine if we have a command
	that can be run anyway.  Thanks to Tom Tromey for the bug report.
	(erc-error): New function that either displays a message or throws
	an error, depending on whether debug-on-error is non-nil.
	(erc-cmd-SERVER, erc-send-current-line): Use it.

2007-07-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Relicense all FSF-assigned code to GPLv3.

2007-06-25  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.texi (Options): Fix typo.
	(Getting Help and Reporting Bugs): Update webpage URL.  Make Gmane
	part more readable.

2007-06-20  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-stamp.el (erc-timestamp-format-left): New option that
	specifies the left timestamp to use for
	erc-insert-timestamp-left-and-right.
	(erc-timestamp-format-right): New option that specifies the right
	timestamp to use for erc-insert-timestamp-left-and-right.
	(erc-insert-timestamp-function): Change default to
	erc-insert-timestamp-left-and-right.
	(erc-insert-away-timestamp-function): Ditto.
	(erc-timestamp-last-inserted-left)
	(erc-timestamp-last-inserted-right): New variables to keep track
	of data for erc-insert-timestamp-left-and-right.
	(erc-insert-timestamp-left-and-right): New function that places
	timestamps on both the left and right sides of the screen, but
	only if each timestamp has changed since it was last computed.
	Thanks to offby1 for urging me to merge this.

	* erc.el (erc-open-ssl-stream): Display informative error when
	ssl.el not found.
	(erc-tls): New function to connect using tls.el.
	(erc-open-tls-stream): New function to initiate tls connection.
	Display informative error when tls.el not found.

2007-06-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-log.el: Update header with accurate instructions.

2007-06-17  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-pkg.el: Update description to match what is currently in ELPA.

2007-06-14  Juanma Barranquero  <lekktu@gmail.com>

	* erc-goodies.el (erc-scroll-to-bottom): Remove redundant check.

2007-06-13  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-compat.el (erc-with-selected-window): New compatibility
	macro that implements `with-selected-window'.

	* erc-goodies.el (erc-scroll-to-bottom): Use it.  This fixes a bug
	with buffer ordering where ERC buffers would move to the top.
	Thanks to Ivan Kanis for the patch.

2007-06-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-log.el (erc-logging-enabled): Fix a bug that occurred when
	`erc-log-channels-directory' had the name of a function.

2007-06-06  Juanma Barranquero  <lekktu@gmail.com>

	* erc.el (erc-show-channel-key-p, erc-startup-file-list):
	Fix typo in docstring.

2007-06-03  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-compat.el (erc-view-mode-enter): Make this its own function,
	in order to document what we do, and provide sane fallback
	behavior.

	* erc.el (erc-toggle-debug-irc-protocol): Don't pass any arguments
	to erc-view-mode-enter, since we don't do anything special with
	the exit function.  This fixes a bug with Emacs 21 and Emacs 22.
	Thanks to Leo for noticing.

2007-05-30  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-compat.el (erc-user-emacs-directory): New variable that
	determines where to find user-specific Emacs settings.  For Emacs,
	this is usually ~/.emacs.d, and for XEmacs this is usually
	~/.xemacs.

	* erc.el (erc-startup-file-list): Use erc-user-emacs-directory.

2007-05-28  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-button.el (erc-button-url-regexp): Recognize parentheses as
	part of URLs.  Thanks to Lawrence Mitchell for the fix.

2007-05-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.texi (Modules): Fix references to completion modules.

2007-05-21  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (SOURCE): Remove erc-pkg.el.
	(debclean): New rule to clean old Debian packages of ERC.
	(debprepare): Don't modify the released tarball, but copy it as
	the .orig.tar.gz file.
	(debrelease, debrevision): Remove.
	(debinstall): New target that copies the generated Debian file to
	a distro-specific location.
	(deb): New rule that chains together the stages in building a
	Debian package.
	(EXTRAS): Add erc-nicklist.el, since it is not release-quality.
	(extras): Copy images directory.

	* erc-nicklist.el (erc-nicklist-icons-directory): Use
	locate-library to find the "images" directory.  This should be
	more failsafe.  Thanks to Tom Tromey for the idea.

2007-05-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (ELPA): New variable that contains the location of my
	local ELPA repository.
	(elpa): New rule that makes an ELPA package for ERC.

2007-04-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-parse-prefix): New function that retrieves the
	PREFIX server parameter from the current server and returns an
	alist of prefix type to prefix character.
	(erc-channel-receive-names): Use `erc-parse-prefix' to determine
	whether the first character of a nick is a prefix character or
	not.  This should fix a bug reported by bromine about needing to
	type "%" first to complete nicks of people who are "hops" on
	Slashnet.  This should also support for very exotic IRC server
	setups, if any exist.
	(erc-update-current-channel-member): Indentation.

2007-04-15  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-log.el (erc-generate-log-file-name-function): Docfix.
	Mention how to deal with the case for putting log files in
	different directories.  Change a customization type from `symbol'
	to `function'.
	(erc-log-channels-directory): Allow this to contain a function
	name, which is called with the same args as in
	`erc-generate-log-file-name-function'.  Thanks to andrewy for the
	report and use case.
	(erc-current-logfile): Detect if `erc-log-channels-directory' is a
	function and call it with arguments if so.

2007-04-12  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (define-erc-response-handler): Mention that hook
	processing stops when the function returns non-nil.  This should
	help avoid a nasty "gotcha" when making custom functions.  Thanks
	to John Sullivan for the report.

2007-04-08  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-nicklist.el (erc-nicklist-voiced-position): Fixed
	customization mismatch.

2007-04-01  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	(TESTING): Remove.
	(EXTRAS): New variable containing the contents of our "Emacs 22
	extras" tarball.
	(SOURCE): Remove $(TESTING).
	(MISC): Add COPYING and ChangeLog.06.  Fix ChangeLog.NNNN ->
	ChangeLog.NN.
	(release): Use $(SNAPDIR) instead of erc-$(VERSION).
	(extras): New rule which implements the building of the extras
	tarball.
	(upload-extras): New rule to upload the extras tarball.  It's
	yucky to replicate upload, but oh well.
	(DISTRIBUTOR): New variable used to differentiate between building
	packages for Ubuntu and Debian.
	(debrelease, debrevision): Use it.
	(debbuild): Run linda in addition to lintian.

	* NEWS: Mention extras tarball.  Note which files have been
	renamed.  Note that erc-list is enabled by default, except in
	Emacs 22.

	* README.extras: New file which serves as a README for the extras
	tarball.

2007-03-31  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Update for the 5.2 release.

	* FOR-RELEASE: Finish up 5.2 manual item.  Add documentation item
	for 5.3.

	* erc.texi (Sample Session): Flesh out.  Mention #erc.
	(Modules): Defer to 5.3 release.
	(Advanced Usage): Move Sample Configuration chapter ahead of
	unfinished chapters.
	(Sample Configuration): Write.
	(Options): Mention how to see available ERC options.  Defer to 5.3
	release.
	(Tips and Tricks): Remove, since it seems better to just include
	tips and tricks in the sample configuration, commented out.

	* erc-bbdb.el (erc-bbdb-search-name-and-create): Make prompt more
	informative about how to skip merging.
	(erc-bbdb-insinuate-and-show-entry-1): Move contents of
	erc-bbdb-insinuate-and-show-entry here.
	(erc-bbdb-insinuate-and-show-entry): Run
	erc-bbdb-insinuate-and-show-entry-1 "outside" of the calling
	function, so that we can avoid triggering a process-filter error
	if the user hits C-g.

2007-03-30  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* FOR-RELEASE: Solve C-c C-SPC keybinding dilemma.

	* erc-autoaway.el (erc-autoaway-idle-method): Use `if' rather than
	`cond' and `set' rather than `set-default'.

	* erc-log.el: Avoid compiler warning by requiring erc-network
	during compilation.
	(erc-generate-log-file-name-function): Add tag to each option.
	Add erc-generate-log-file-name-network.
	(erc-generate-log-file-name-network): New function which generates
	a log file name that uses network name rather than server name,
	when possible.

	* erc-track.el (track): Assimilate track-when-inactive module,
	since there's no need to have two modules in one file -- an option
	will do.  Remove track-modified-channels alias.  Call
	erc-track-minor-mode-maybe, and tear down the minor mode when
	disabling.
	(erc-track-when-inactive): New option which determines whether to
	track visible buffers when inactive.  The default is not to do so.
	(erc-track-visibility): Mention erc-track-when-inactive.
	(erc-buffer-visible): Use erc-track-when-inactive.
	(erc-track-enable-keybindings): New option which determines
	whether to enable the global-level tracking keybindings.  The
	default is to do so, unless they would override another binding,
	in which case we prompt the user about it.
	(erc-track-minor-mode-map): Move global keybindings here.
	(erc-track-minor-mode): New minor mode which only enables the
	keybindings and does nothing else.
	(erc-track-minor-mode-maybe): New function which starts
	erc-track-minor-mode, but only if it hasn't already been started,
	an ERC buffer exists, and the user OK's it, depending on the value
	of `erc-track-enable-keybindings'.
	(erc-track-switch-buffer): Display a message if someone calls this
	without first enabling erc-track-mode.

2007-03-17  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.texi (Development): Mention ErcDevelopment page on
	emacswiki.
	(Getting Started): Mention ~/.emacs.d/.ercrc.el and the Customize
	interface.
	(Sample Session): New section that has a very rough draft for a
	sample ERC session.

	features of ERC.  Taken from ErcFeatures on emacswiki, with
	enhancements.

2007-03-12  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-autoaway.el (erc-autoaway-idle-method): When setting the new
	value, disable and re-enable `erc-autoaway-mode' only if it was
	already enabled.  This fixes a bug where autoaway was enabled just
	by loading the file.

2007-03-10  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-capab.el: Added more information to the Usage section.
	(erc-capab-identify-prefix): Doc fix.
	(erc-capab-identify-unidentified): New face.
	(290): Removed.  Definition moved to erc-backend.el.
	(erc-capab-identify-send-messages): Renamed from
	`erc-capab-send-identify-messages'.
	(erc-capab-identify-setup): Use it.
	(erc-capab-identify-get-unidentified-nickname): Renamed from
	`erc-capab-get-unidentified-nickname'.
	(erc-capab-identify-add-prefix): Use it.  Use
	`erc-capab-identify-unidentified' as the face.

	* erc-backend.el (290): Moved here from erc-capab.el.

	* erc.el (erc-select): Added an autoload cookie.
	(erc-message-type-member, erc-restore-text-properties): Use
	`erc-get-parsed-vector'.
	(erc-auto-query): Set the default to 'bury since many new users
	expect private messages from others to be in dedicated query
	buffers, not the server buffer.
	(erc-common-server-suffixes): Use "freenode" for freenode.net, not
	"OPN".  Added oftc.net.

	* NEWS: Added note about erc-auto-query's new default setting.

2007-03-03  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-open, erc): Docfixes.

2007-03-02  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* FOR-RELEASE: Make section for 5.3 release and move erc-backend
	cleanup there.  Awaiting discussion before doing other things.
	Add tasks for merging filename changes from the 5.2 release
	branch, and for making a tarball of modules not in Emacs 22.  Add
	item to remind me to update NEWS.  Mark backtab entry as done.

	* erc-button.el (button): Add call to `erc-button-add-keys'.
	(erc-button-keys-added): New variable tracking whether we've added
	the keys yet.
	(erc-button-add-keys): New function that adds the <backtab> key to
	erc-mode-map.

	* erc.texi: Change version to 5.2 (pre-release).

2007-02-15  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* CREDITS: Update.

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-send-ping-interval): Change to use a
	default of 30 seconds.  Improve customize interface.
	(erc-server-send-ping-timeout): New option that determines when to
	consider a connection stalled and restart it.  The default is
	after 120 seconds.
	(erc-server-send-ping): Use erc-server-send-ping-timeout instead
	of erc-server-send-ping-interval.  If
	erc-server-send-ping-timeout is nil, do not ever kill and restart
	a hung IRC process.

	* erc.el (erc-modules): Include the name of the module in its
	description.  This should make it easier for people to find and
	enable a particular module.

2007-02-15  Vivek Dasmohapatra  <vivek@etla.org>

	* erc.el (erc-cmd-RECONNECT): Kill old process if it is still
	alive.
	(erc-message-english-PART): Properly escape "%" characters in
	reason.

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-reconnecting): New variable that is
	set when the user requests a reconnect, but the old process is
	still alive.  This forces the reconnect to work even though the
	process is killed manually during reconnect.
	(erc-server-connect): Initialize it.
	(erc-server-reconnect-p): Use it.
	(erc-process-sentinel-1): Set it to nil after the first reconnect
	attempt.

2007-02-07  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-menu.el (erc-menu-definition): Fixed so that the separator
	is between "Current channel" and "Pals, fools and other keywords",
	not at the bottom of the "Current channel" submenu.

2007-01-25  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-networks.el (erc-server-alist): Removed SSL server for now
	since `erc-server-select' doesn't know to use `erc-ssl'.

	* erc-networks.el (erc-server-alist, erc-networks-alist): Added
	definitions for oftc.net.

	* erc-services.el (erc-nickserv-alist): Fixed OFTC message regexp.

2007-01-22  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-error-occurred): New variable that
	indicates when an error has been signaled by the server.  This
	should fix an infinite reconnect bug when giving some servers a
	bogus :full-name.  Thanks to Angelina Carlton for the report.
	(erc-server-connect): Initialize erc-server-error-occurred.
	(erc-server-reconnect-p): Use it.
	(ERROR): Set it.

	* erc-services.el (erc-nickserv-alist): Alphabetize and add Ars
	and QuakeNet.  Standardize look of entries.  Fix type mismatch
	error in customize interface.
	(erc-nickserv-passwords): Alphabetize and add missing entries from
	erc-nickserv-alist.

2007-01-21  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-header-line-format): Document how to disable the
	header line, and add a customization type for it.  Also, make the
	changes take effect immediately.

2007-01-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.texi (Modules): Document new menu module.  Thanks to Leo
	for noticing.

2007-01-16  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-stamp.el (erc-insert-timestamp-left): Fixed so that the
	whitespace string filler is hidden correctly when timestamps are
	hidden.
	(erc-toggle-timestamps): New function to use instead of
	`erc-show-timestamps' and `erc-hide-timestamps'.

	* erc.el (erc-restore-text-properties): Moved here from
	erc-fill.el since it could be useful in general.

	* erc-fill.el (erc-restore-text-properties): Removed.

2007-01-13  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-command-regexp): New variable that is used to match
	a command.
	(erc-send-input): Use it.  This fixes a bug where paths --
	"/usr/bin/foo", for example -- were being displayed as commands,
	but still sent correctly.
	(erc-extract-command-from-line): Use it.

	* erc.texi (Modules): Document erc-capab-identify.

2007-01-11  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc.el (erc-find-parsed-property): Moved here from erc-track.el
	since it can be useful in general.

	* erc-track.el (erc-find-parsed-property): Removed.

	* erc-capab.el (erc-capab-find-parsed): Removed.
	(erc-capab-identify-add-prefix): Use `erc-find-parsed-property'.

	* erc.el (erc-open): Run `erc-before-connect' hook here.  This
	makes sure the hook always gets called before a connection is
	made, as some functions, like `erc-handle-irc-url', use `erc-open'
	instead of `erc'.
	(erc): Removed `erc-before-connect' hook.

	* erc-menu.el (erc-menu-definition): Put items specific to
	channels in a "Current channel" submenu.

	* erc-backend.el (321, 323): Display channel list in server buffer
	when not using the channel list module.

	* erc.el: Updated copyright years.
	(erc-version-string): Set to 5.2 (devel).
	(erc-format-lag-time): Fixed to work when `erc-server-lag' is nil.
	(erc-update-mode-line-buffer): Set the header face.

2007-01-11  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-bbdb.el (erc-bbdb-popup-type): Fix customization type and
	documentation.

	* erc-services.el (erc-nickserv-identify-mode): Improve
	documentation for nick-change option and move higher to fix
	compiler warning.  Avoid a recursive load error.
	(erc-nickserv-alist): Add simple entry for BitlBee, to avoid
	"NickServ is AWAY: User is offline" error.  Oddly enough, bitlbee
	was smart enough to recognize that as an authentication request
	and log in regardless, which is why I didn't notice this earlier.
	(erc-nickserv-alist-sender, erc-nickserv-alist-regexp)
	(erc-nickserv-alist-nickserv, erc-nickserv-alist-ident-keyword)
	(erc-nickserv-alist-use-nick-p)
	(erc-nickserv-alist-ident-command): New accessors for
	erc-nickserv-alist.  Using nth is unwieldy.
	(erc-nickserv-identify-autodetect)
	(erc-nickserv-identify-on-connect)
	(erc-nickserv-identify-on-nick-change, erc-nickserv-identify): Use
	the new accessors.

2007-01-11  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* NEWS: Added note for `erc-my-nick-face'.  Fixed capab-identify
	wording.

2007-01-10  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc.el (erc-mode-line-format): Added %l to documentation.
	(erc-header-line-format): Removed "[IRC]".  Use the new %l
	replacement character.  Doc fix.
	(erc-format-channel-modes): Removed lag code.  Removed parentheses
	from mode string.
	(erc-format-lag-time): New function.
	(erc-update-mode-line-buffer): Use it.

2007-01-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

2007-01-09  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-system-name): New option that determines the system
	name to use when logging in.  The default is to figure this out by
	calling `system-name'.
	(erc-login): Use it.

2007-01-07  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-modules): Add the menu module.  This should fix a
	bug with incorrect ERC submenus being displayed.

	* erc-menu.el: Turn this into a module.
	(erc-menu-add, erc-menu-remove): New functions that add and remove
	the ERC menu.
