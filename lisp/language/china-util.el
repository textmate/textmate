;; Hz/ZW/EUC-TW encoding stuff

;; HZ is an encoding method for Chinese character set GB2312 used
;; widely in Internet.  It is very similar to 7-bit environment of
;; ISO-2022.  The difference is that HZ uses the sequence "犷换" for designating GB2312 and ASCII respectively, hence, it
;; doesn't uses ESC (0x1B) code.

;; ZW is another encoding method for Chinese character set GB2312.  It
;; encodes Chinese characters line by line by starting each line with
;; the sequence "zW".  It also uses only 7-bit as HZ.

;; EUC-TW is similar to EUC-KS or EUC-JP.  Its main character set is
;; plane 1 of CNS 11643; characters of planes 2 to 7 are accessed with
;; a single shift escape followed by three bytes: the first gives the
;; plane, the second and third the character code.  Note that characters
;; of plane 1 are (redundantly) accessible with a single shift escape
;; also.
