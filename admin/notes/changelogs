entry in their name, not yours.

  There is no need to make change log entries for files such as NEWS,
  MAINTAINERS, and FOR-RELEASE.

  There is no need to indicate regeneration of files such as configure
  in ChangeLog.

Preferred form for several entries with the same content:

   * help.el (view-lossage):
   * kmacro.el (kmacro-edit-lossage):
   * edmacro.el (edit-kbd-macro): Fix docstring, lossage is now 300 keys.

(Rather than anything involving "ditto" and suchlike.)
