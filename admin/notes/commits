HOW TO COMMIT CHANGES TO EMACS

Most of these points are from:

(0) Each commit should correspond to a single change (whether spread
    over multiple files or not).  Do not mix different changes in the
    same commit (eg adding a feature in one file, fixing a bug in
    another should be two commits, not one).

(1) Commit all changed files at once with a single log message (which
    in CVS will result in an identical log message for all committed
    files), not one-by-one.  This is pretty easy using vc-dir now.

(2) Make the log message describe the entire changeset, perhaps
    including relevant changelog entries (I often don't bother with
    the latter if it's a trivial sort of change).

    Many modern source-control systems vaguely distinguish the first
    line of the log message to use as a short summary for abbreviated
    history listing (in arch this was explicitly called the summary,
    but many other systems have a similar concept).  So it's nice if
    you can format the log entry like:

        SHORTISH ONE-LINE SUMMARY

        MULTIPLE-LINE DETAILED DESCRIPTION POSSIBLY INCLUDING (OR
        CONSISTING OF) CHANGELOG ENTRIES

    [Even with CVS this style is useful, because web CVS browsing
    interfaces often include the first N words of the log message of
    the most recent commit as a short "most recent change"
    description.]

(3) Don't phrase log messages assuming the filename is known, because
    in non-file-oriented systems (everything modern other than CVS),
    the log listing tends to be treated as global information, and the
    connection with specific files is less explicit.

    For instance, currently I often see log messages like "Regenerate";
    for modern source-control systems with a global log, it's better to
    have something like "Regenerate configure".
