Tasks needed before the next release.

* TO BE DONE SHORTLY BEFORE RELEASE

** Manuals
Check cross-references between the manuals (eg from emacs to elisp)
are correct.  You can use something like the following in the info
directory in the Emacs build tree:

emacs -Q --eval "(progn (require 'info) (setq Info-directory-list '(\".\")))" \
  -f info-xref-check-all

make emacs.dvi, elisp.dvi, and deal with any errors (undefined
references etc) in the output.  Break any overfull lines.
Underfull hboxes are not serious, but it can be nice to get rid of
them if a simple rephrasing or rearrangement will work.

Update the master menu and detailed menu (eg the antinews version).
The command texinfo-multiple-files-update can do this, but you
probably want to apply the results selectively (eg the current master
menu has better line-breaks than the automatic version).  It includes
the menu-entry name (if there is one) as well as the node name - using
only the latter looks better.  Also, it doesn't seem to handle nested
includes, so will miss edebug.texi etc.

Check for widow and orphan lines in the printed manual; make sure all
the pages really look ok in the manual as formatted.  Orphans/widows
are cases where the first/last line of a paragraph is on its own at
the end/start of a page, or where the last word in a paragraph is on
its own at the start of a line.  It looks better if you reword/respace
things to avoid these.  (AFAIK, there is no way to find these except
paging through the whole manual.)  This should be the very last thing
you do, since any change can alter the layout.
(Actually, there is probably little point in trying to do this.
It's only really relevant if printed versions of the manuals are going
to be published.  End-users are not likely to print out all 1000+
pages of the manuals, and even if they do, the resulting page breaks
depend on what paper and font size they use.  This also means that if
you _are_ going to do this, it should be done with the paper and font
size that the GNU Press are going to use when they print the manuals.
I think this is different to what you get if you just use eg `make
emacs.pdf' (e.g., enable "smallbook").

** Check the keybindings in the refcards are correct, and add any new ones.
Regenerate the pdf versions in etc/refcards/.
What paper size are the English versions supposed to be on?
On Debian testing, the packages texlive-lang-czechslovak and
texlive-lang-polish will let you generate the cs-* and sk-* pdfs.
(You may need texlive-lang-cyrillic, texlive-lang-german for others.)
The Makefile rules did not work for me, I had to use something like:
csplain -output-format=pdf cs-refcard

** Ask maintainers of refcard translations to update them.

Emacs 22 translators:

LANG	Translator            Status
cs	Pavel Janík           
de	Sven Joachim          
fr	Eric Jacoboni         
pl	Włodek Bzyl           
pt-br	Rodrigo Real          
ru	Alex Ott              
sk	Miroslav Vaško        

** For a major release, add a "New in Emacs XX" section to faq.texi.

** Remove temporary +++/--- lines in NEWS.

** Try to reorder NEWS: most important things first, related items together.

** Consider bumping customize-changed-options-previous-release.

** cusver-check from admin.el can help find new defcustoms missing
:version tags.

* BUGS

** Check for modes which bind M-s that conflicts with a new global binding M-s
and change key bindings where necessary.  The current list of modes:

1. Gnus binds `M-s' to `gnus-summary-search-article-forward'.

2. Minibuffer binds `M-s' to `next-matching-history-element'
   (not useful any more since C-s can now search in the history).

3. `center-line' in Text mode was already moved to the text formatting
   keymap as `M-o M-s' (thus this binding is not necessary any more
   in `nroff-mode-map' too and can be removed now from the nroff mode
   because it can now use the global key binding `M-o M-s' `center-line').

4. PCL-CVS binds `M-s' to `cvs-status', and log-edit-mode binds it to
   `log-edit-comment-search-forward'.  Perhaps search commands
   on the global key binding `M-s' are useless in these modes.

5. Rmail binds `\es' to `rmail-search'/`rmail-summary-search'.


* DOCUMENTATION

** Check the Emacs Tutorial.

The first line of every tutorial must begin with text ending in a
period (".", ASCII 0x2E) saying "Emacs Tutorial" in the respective
language. This should be followed by "See end for copying conditions",
likewise in the respective language.

After each file name, on the same line or the following line, come the
names of the people who have checked it.
