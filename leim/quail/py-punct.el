This is the combination of the input methods `chinese-py' and `chinese-punct'.
You can enter normal Chinese characters by the same way as `chinese-py'.
And, you can enter symbols by typing `v' followed by any key sequences
defined in `chinese-punct'.

For instance, typing `v' and `%' insert `$A#%(B'.
