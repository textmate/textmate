This directory contains scripts for building the DJGPP (a.k.a. MS-DOS)
version of Emacs, and other files useful for running that version of
Emacs.

The files emacs.ico and emacs.pif are for using the DJGPP version on
Windows 3.X.  Since these are binary files, their copyright notice is

NOTE ON THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE FILES IS_EXEC.C, SIGACTION.C

As distributed with GNU Emacs, the files is_exec.c and sigaction.c are
Copyright (C) 1995 DJ Delorie, and are licensed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License version 3 (see COPYING), or (at your
option) any later version.

Here we record the details of the legal history of these files.

The files is_exec.c and sigaction.c were originally part of DJGPP,
distributed by DJ Delorie. The versions of these files in DJGPP
contain the following license notice:

  Copyright (C) 1995 DJ Delorie, see COPYING.DJ for details

The contents of the file COPYING.DJ (as available at, for example, the
URL: <http://www.delorie.com/bin/cvsweb.cgi/djgpp/copying.dj>) are as
follows:

-- COPYING.DJ STARTS HERE --

This is the file "COPYING.DJ".  It does NOT apply to any sources or
binaries copyrighted by UCB Berkeley, the Free Software Foundation, or
any other agency besides DJ Delorie and others who have agreed to
allow their sources to be distributed under these terms.

This document is Copyright (C) DJ Delorie and may be distributed
verbatim, but changing it is not allowed.

Source code copyright DJ Delorie is distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License, with the following exceptions:

* Sources used to build crt0.o, gcrt0.o, libc.a, libdbg.a, and
  libemu.a are distributed under the terms of the GNU Library General
  Public License, rather than the GNU GPL.

* Any existing copyright or authorship information in any given source
  file must remain intact.  If you modify a source file, a notice to that
  effect must be added to the authorship information in the source file.

* Runtime binaries, as provided by DJ in DJGPP, may be distributed
  without sources ONLY if the recipient is given sufficient information
  to obtain a copy of djgpp themselves.  This primarily applies to
  go32-v2.exe, emu387.dxe, and stubedit.exe.

* Runtime objects and libraries, as provided by DJ in DJGPP, when
  linked into an application, may be distributed without sources ONLY
  if the recipient is given sufficient information to obtain a copy of
  djgpp themselves.  This primarily applies to crt0.o and libc.a.

Changes to source code copyright BSD, FSF, or others, by DJ Delorie
fall under the terms of the original copyright.  Such files usually
have multiple copyright notices in them.

A copy of the files "COPYING" and "COPYING.LIB" are included with this
document.  If you did not receive a copy of these files, you may
obtain one from whence this document was obtained, or by writing:

-- COPYING.DJ ENDS HERE --

Both is_exec.c and sigaction.c are parts of DJGPP's libc.a, therefore
according to exception 1 in the above terms their "base" license is
the GNU Library General Public License [now known as the GNU Lesser
General Public License].

The terms of the GNU LGPL, specifically clause 3, which begins:

    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General
    Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the
    Library.

permit us to relicense the files is_exec.c and sigaction.c as used in
GNU Emacs under the terms of the GNU GPL.

COPYING.DJ, however, lists extra exceptions 2-4 to the GNU licenses.
Items 3 and 4 are not relevant in the case of GNU Emacs, since they
can only apply to copies of DJGPP [confirmed by email from DJ Delorie
to rms at gnu.org and others, 2007/01/31].

Exception 2 of COPYING.DJ, when viewed as an added restriction, rather
than as an interpretation of the GPL, leads to problems. The added
requirement makes the overall license of the file incompatible with
the GNU GPL.

As a solution to this problem, DJ Delorie has kindly granted (February
2007) GNU Emacs an exception, and permits us to license the files
is_exec.c and sigaction.c solely under the terms of the GNU GPL. This
exception applies _only_ to these files as distributed with GNU Emacs.
This solution was arrived at in an email discussion between DJ Delorie
<dj at delorie.com> and Richard Stallman <rms at gnu.org> in
January/February 2007. We record below a summary of the relevant final
email in this discussion:

    From: DJ Delorie <dj at delorie.com>
    To: rms at gnu.org
    Subject: Re: COPYING.DJ and Emacsn

    I have no problem with whatever you wish to do with those files in
    emacs (as long as djgpp itself doesn't need to change).


Accordingly, in February 2007 we relicensed the files is_exec.c and
sigaction.c as used in GNU Emacs under the GNU GPL.
