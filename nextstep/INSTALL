Compilation
-----------

In the top-level directory, use:

  ./configure --with-ns

This will compile all the files, but emacs will not be able to be run except
in -nw (terminal) mode.

In order to run Emacs.app, you must run:

  make install

This will assemble the app in nextstep/Emacs.app.

If you pass the --disable-ns-self-contained option to configure, the lisp
files will be installed under whatever 'prefix' is set to (defaults to
/usr/local).  The bundle will be smaller, but depend on these resources (may
require 'sudo' for "make install").


Installation
------------

Move nextstep/Emacs.app to any desired install location.


Distributions and Universal Binaries
------------------------------------

Building as outlined above will create ordinary binaries running on your
architecture only.  To create universal binaries, set CFLAGS to include
"-arch ppc -arch i386".
