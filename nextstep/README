This directory contains the files needed to build Emacs on
Nextstep-based platforms, including GNUstep and Mac OS X.

The Nextstep support code works on many POSIX systems (and possibly
W32) using the GNUstep libraries, and on MacOS X systems using the
Cocoa libraries.

See the INSTALL file in this directory for compilation instructions.

Requirements
------------
MacOS X 10.4 or later

- or -

GNUstep "Startup 0.23" or later
Tested on GNU/Linux, should work on other systems, perhaps with minor
build tweaking.
