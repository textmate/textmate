1 Overview
**********

EUDC, the "Emacs Unified Directory Client", provides a common user
interface to access directory servers using different directory
protocols.

   Currently supported back-ends are:

   * LDAP, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

   * CCSO PH/QI

   * BBDB, Big Brother's Insidious Database

   The main features of the EUDC interface are:

   * Queries using a customizable form

   * Inline query expansion (for instance you can expand a name to an
     email address in a mail message buffer using a server as an
     address book)

   * Multiple servers can be tried in turn until a match is found for an
     inline query

   * Fast minibuffer queries for email addresses and phone numbers

   * Interface to BBDB to let you insert server records into your own
     BBDB database (*note BBDB: (bbdb)Top.)

* Menu:

* LDAP::                        What is LDAP ?

1.1 LDAP
========

LDAP, "the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol", is a communication
protocol for directory applications defined in RFC 1777.

   Quoted from RFC 1777:

     [LDAP] is designed to provide access to the X.500 Directory while
     not incurring the resource requirements of the Directory Access
     Protocol (DAP). This protocol is specifically targeted at simple
     management applications and browser applications that provide
     simple read/write interactive access to the X.500 Directory, and
     is intended to be a complement to the DAP itself.

   LDAP servers usually store (but are not limited to) information about
people such as their name, phone number, email address, office
location, etc... More information about LDAP can be found at
`http://www.openldap.org/'.

   EUDC requires external support to access LDAP directory servers
(*note LDAP Requirements::)


File: eudc,  Node: CCSO PH/QI,  Next: BBDB,  Prev: LDAP,  Up: Overview

1.2 CCSO PH/QI
==============

The Central Computing Services Office (CCSO) of the University of
Illinois at Urbana Champaign created and freely distributed a directory
system that was used by many organizations in the 1990s.  The system
records information about people such as their address, phone number,
email, academic information or any other details it was configured to.
Nowadays this system is not widely used.

   The system consists of two parts: a database server traditionally
called `qi' and a command-line client called `ph'.  As of 2010, the
code can still be downloaded from `http://www-dev.cites.uiuc.edu/ph/'.

   The original command-line `ph' client that comes with the `ph/qi'
distribution provides additional features like the possibility to
communicate with the server in login-mode which makes it possible to
change records in the database.  This is not implemented in EUDC.


File: eudc,  Node: BBDB,  Prev: CCSO PH/QI,  Up: Overview

1.3 BBDB
========

BBDB is the "Big Brother's Insidious Database", a package for Emacs
originally written by Jamie Zawinski which provides rolodex-like
database functionality featuring tight integration with the Emacs mail
and news readers.

   It is often used as an enhanced email address book.

   EUDC considers BBDB as a directory server back end just like LDAP or
PH/QI servers, though BBDB has no client/server protocol and thus always
resides locally on your machine.  The point in this is not to offer an
alternate way to query your BBDB database (BBDB itself provides much
more flexible ways to do that), but rather to offer an interface to your
local directory that is consistent with the interface to external
directories (LDAP, PH/QI).  This is particularly interesting when
performing queries on multiple servers.

   EUDC also offers a means to insert results from directory queries
into your own local BBDB (*note Creating BBDB Records::)

2 Installation
**************

Add the following to your `.emacs' init file:
     (require 'eudc)
   This will install EUDC at startup.

   After installing EUDC you will find (the next time you launch Emacs)
a new `Directory Search' submenu in the `Tools' menu that will give you
access to EUDC.

   You may also find it useful to add the following to your `.emacs'
initialization file to add a shortcut for email address expansion in
email composition buffers (*note Inline Query Expansion::)

     (eval-after-load
      "message"
      '(define-key message-mode-map [(control ?c) (tab)] 'eudc-expand-inline))
     (eval-after-load
      "sendmail"
      '(define-key mail-mode-map [(control ?c) (tab)] 'eudc-expand-inline))

2.1 LDAP Requirements
=====================

LDAP support is added by means of `ldap.el', which is part of Emacs.
`ldap.el' needs an external command line utility named `ldapsearch',
available as part of Open LDAP (`http://www.openldap.org/').

3.1 Querying Servers
====================

EUDC's basic functionality is to let you query a directory server and
return the results back to you.  There are several things you may want
to customize in this process.

* Menu:

* Selecting a Server::          The first thing to do
* Return Attributes::           Configuring what the server should return
* Duplicate Attributes::        What to do when records have duplicate attributes


File: eudc,  Node: Selecting a Server,  Next: Return Attributes,  Prev: Querying Servers,  Up: Querying Servers

3.1.1 Selecting a Server
------------------------

Before doing any query you will need to set the directory server.  You
need to specify the name of the host machine running the server software
and the protocol to use. If you do not set the server in any fashion,
EUDC will ask you for one when you make your first query.

   You can set the server by selecting one from your hotlist of servers
(*note The Server Hotlist::) available in the `Server' submenu or by
selecting `New Server' in that same menu.

   LDAP servers generally require some configuration before you can
perform queries on them.  In particular, the "search base" must be
configured.  If the server you select has no configured search base then
EUDC will propose you to configure it at this point.  A customization
buffer will be displayed where you can edit the search base and other
parameters for the server.

 -- Variable: eudc-server
     The name or IP address of the remote directory server. A TCP port
     number may be specified by appending a colon and a number to the
     name of the server. You will not need this unless your server runs
     on a port other than the default (which depends on the protocol).
     If the directory server resides on your own computer (which is the
     case if you use the BBDB back end) then `localhost' is a
     reasonable value but it will be ignored anyway.

 -- Variable: eudc-protocol
     The directory protocol to use to query the server.  Currently
     supported protocols in this version of EUDC are `ph', `ldap' and
     `bbdb'.

 -- Command: eudc-set-server
     This command accessible from `New Server' submenu lets you specify
     a new directory server and protocol.


File: eudc,  Node: Return Attributes,  Next: Duplicate Attributes,  Prev: Selecting a Server,  Up: Querying Servers

3.1.2 Return Attributes
-----------------------

Directory servers may be configured to return a default set of
attributes for each record matching a query if the query specifies none.
The variable `eudc-default-return-attributes' controls the return
attributes you want to see, if different from the server defaults.

 -- Variable: eudc-default-return-attributes
     A list of the default attributes to extract from directory
     entries.  If set to the symbol `all' then all available attributes
     are returned. A value of `nil', the default, means to return the
     default attributes as configured in the server.

   The server may return several matching records to a query. Some of
the records may however not contain all the attributes you requested.
You can discard those records.

 -- User Option: eudc-strict-return-matches
     If non-`nil', entries that do not contain all the requested return
     attributes are ignored.  Default is `t'.


File: eudc,  Node: Duplicate Attributes,  Prev: Return Attributes,  Up: Querying Servers

3.1.3 Duplicate Attributes
--------------------------

Directory standards may authorize different instances of the same
attribute in a record. For instance the record of a person may contain
several email fields containing different email addresses. When using a
QI directory server this is difficult to distinguish from attributes
having multi-line values such as the postal address that may contain a
line for the street and another one for the zip code and city name. In
both cases, EUDC will consider the attribute duplicated.

   EUDC has several methods to deal with duplicated attributes. The
available methods are:

`list'
     Makes a list with the different values of the duplicate attribute.
     The record is returned with only one instance of the attribute
     with a list of all the different values as a value. This is the
     default method that is used to handle duplicate fields for which
     no other method has been specified.

`first'
     Discards all the duplicate values of the field keeping only the
     first one.

`concat'
     Concatenates the different values using a newline as a separator.
     The record keeps only one instance of the field the value of which
     is a single multi-line string.

`duplicate'
     Duplicates the whole record into as many instances as there are
     different values for the field. This is the default for the email
     field. Thus a record containing 3 different email addresses is
     duplicated into three different records each having a single email
     address. This is particularly useful in combination with `select'
     as the method to handle multiple matches in inline expansion
     queries (*note Inline Query Expansion::) because you are presented
     with the 3 addresses in a selection buffer

   Because a method may not be applicable to all fields, the variable
`eudc-duplicate-attribute-handling-method' lets you specify either a
default method for all fields or a method for each individual field.

 -- Variable: eudc-duplicate-attribute-handling-method
     A method to handle entries containing duplicate attributes.  This
     is either an alist of elements `(ATTR . METHOD)', or a symbol
     METHOD.  The alist form of the variable associates a method to an
     individual attribute name; the second form specifies a method
     applicable to all attribute names. Available methods are: `list',
     `first', `concat', and `duplicate' (see above).  The default is
     `list'.


File: eudc,  Node: Query Form,  Next: Display of Query Results,  Prev: Querying Servers,  Up: Usage

3.2 Query Form
==============

The simplest way to query your directory server is to use the query
form. You display the query form with the `Query with Form' menu item
or by invoking the command `M-x eudc-query-form'. The attribute names
presented in this form are defined by the `eudc-query-form-attributes'
variable (unless a non-`nil' argument is supplied to `eudc-query-form').

   Since the different directory protocols to which EUDC interfaces may
use different names for equivalent attributes, EUDC defines its own set
of attribute names and a mapping between these names and their
protocol-specific equivalent through the variable
`eudc-protocol-attributes-translation-alist'.  Names currently defined
by EUDC are `name', `firstname', `email' and `phone'.

 -- Variable: eudc-query-form-attributes
     A list of attributes presented in the query form.  Attribute names
     in this list should be either EUDC attribute names or valid
     attribute names.  You can get a list of valid attribute names for
     the current protocol with the `List Valid Attribute Names' menu
     item or the `M-x eudc-get-attribute-list' command.  Defaults to
     `name', `email' and `phone'.

 -- Command: eudc-query-form get-fields-from-server
     Display a form to query the directory server.  If given a non-`nil'
     argument the function first queries the server for the existing
     fields and displays a corresponding form.  Not all protocols may
     support a non-`nil' argument here.

   Since the names of the fields may not be explicit enough or adapted
to be directly displayed as prompt strings in the form, the variable
`eudc-user-attribute-names-alist' lets you define more explicit names
for directory attribute names.  This variable is ignored if
`eudc-use-raw-directory-names' is non-`nil'.

 -- Variable: eudc-user-attribute-names-alist
     This is an alist of user-defined names for the directory
     attributes used in query/response forms. Prompt strings for
     attributes that are not in this alist are derived by splitting the
     attribute name at underscores and capitalizing the individual
     words.

 -- Variable: eudc-use-raw-directory-names
     If non-`nil', use attributes names as defined in the directory.
     Otherwise, directory query/response forms display the user
     attribute names defined in `eudc-user-attribute-names-alist'.


File: eudc,  Node: Display of Query Results,  Next: Inline Query Expansion,  Prev: Query Form,  Up: Usage

3.3 Display of Query Results
============================

Upon successful completion of a form query, EUDC will display a buffer
containing the results of the query.

   The fields that are returned for each record are controlled by
`eudc-default-return-attributes' (*note Return Attributes::).

   The display of each individual field can be performed by an arbitrary
function which allows specific processing for binary values, such as
images or audio samples, as well as values with semantics, such as URLs.

 -- Variable: eudc-attribute-display-method-alist
     An alist specifying methods to display attribute values.  Each
     member of the list is of the form `(NAME . FUNC)' where NAME is a
     lowercased string naming a directory attribute (translated
     according to `eudc-user-attribute-names-alist' if
     `eudc-use-raw-directory-names' is non-`nil') and FUNC a function
     that will be passed the corresponding attribute values for display.

   This variable has protocol-local definitions (see *note
Server/Protocol Locals::).  For instance, it is defined as follows for
LDAP:

     (eudc-protocol-set 'eudc-attribute-display-method-alist
                        '(("jpegphoto" . eudc-display-jpeg-inline)
                          ("labeledurl" . eudc-display-url)
                          ("audio" . eudc-display-sound)
                          ("labeledurl" . eudc-display-url)
                          ("url" . eudc-display-url))
                        'ldap)

   EUDC provides a set of built-in functions to display binary value
types:

 -- Function: eudc-display-generic-binary data
     Display a button for unidentified binary DATA.

 -- Function: eudc-display-url url
     Display URL and make it clickable.

 -- Function: eudc-display-sound data
     Display a button to play the sound DATA.

 -- Function: eudc-display-jpeg-inline data
     Display the JPEG DATA inline at point if possible.

 -- Function: eudc-display-jpeg-as-button data
     Display a button for the JPEG DATA.

   Right-clicking on a binary value button pops up a contextual menu
with options to process the value.  Among these are saving the attribute
value to a file or sending it to an external viewer command.  External
viewers should expect the value on their standard input and should
display it or perform arbitrary processing on it.  Messages sent to
standard output are discarded.  External viewers are listed in the
variable `eudc-external-viewers' which you can customize.

 -- Variable: eudc-external-viewers
     This is a list of viewer program specifications.  Each
     specification is a list whose first element is a string naming the
     viewer for unique identification, the second element is the
     executable program which should be invoked and the following
     elements are arguments that should be passed to the program.


File: eudc,  Node: Inline Query Expansion,  Next: The Server Hotlist,  Prev: Display of Query Results,  Up: Usage

3.4 Inline Query Expansion
==========================

Inline query expansion is a powerful method to get completion from your
directory server.  The most common usage is for expanding names to email
addresses in mail message buffers.  The expansion is performed by the
command `M-x eudc-expand-inline' which is available from the `Expand
Inline Query' menu item but can also be conveniently bound to a key
shortcut (*note Installation::).  The operation is controlled by the
variables `eudc-inline-expansion-format', `eudc-inline-query-format',
`eudc-expanding-overwrites-query' and
`eudc-multiple-match-handling-method'.

   If the query fails for a server, other servers may be tried
successively until one of them finds a match (*note Multi-server
Queries::).

 -- Command: eudc-expand-inline replace-p
     Query the server and expand the query string before point.  The
     query string consists of the buffer substring from the point back
     to the preceding comma, colon or beginning of line.
     `eudc-inline-query-format' controls how individual words are
     mapped onto directory attribute names.  After querying the server
     for the given string, the expansion specified by
     `eudc-inline-expansion-format' is inserted in the buffer at point.
     If REPLACE-P is `t' then this expansion replaces the query string
     in the buffer.  If `eudc-expanding-overwrites-query' is non-`nil'
     then the meaning of REPLACE-P is negated.

 -- Variable: eudc-inline-query-format
     Format of an inline expansion query.  This is actually a list of
     FORMATs.  A FORMAT is a list of one or more EUDC attribute names.
     A FORMAT applies if it contains as many attributes as individual
     words in the inline query string.  If several FORMATs apply then
     they are tried in order until a match is found.  If `nil' all the
     words will be mapped onto the default server/protocol attribute
     name (generally `name').

     For instance, use the following
          (setq eudc-inline-query-format '((name)
                                           (firstname)
                                           (firstname name)))
     to indicate that single word expansion queries are to be
     considered as surnames and if no match is found then they should
     be tried as first names.  Inline queries consisting of two words
     are considered as consisting of a first name followed by a
     surname.  If the query consists of more than two words, then the
     first one is considered as the first name and the remaining words
     are all considered as surname constituents.

     FORMATs are in fact not limited to EUDC attribute names, you can
     use server or protocol specific names in them.  It may be safer if
     you do so, to set the variable `eudc-inline-query-format' in a
     protocol or server local fashion (see *note Server/Protocol
     Locals::).

     For instance you could use the following to match up to three words
     against the `cn' attribute of LDAP servers:
          (eudc-protocol-set 'eudc-inline-query-format
                             '((cn)
                               (cn cn)
                               (cn cn cn))
                             'ldap)

 -- Variable: eudc-inline-expansion-format
     This variable lets you control exactly what is inserted into the
     buffer upon an inline expansion request.  It is a list whose first
     element is a string passed to `format'.  Remaining elements are
     symbols corresponding to directory attribute names.  The
     corresponding attribute values are passed as additional arguments
     to `format'.  Default is `("%s" email)' but you may want to
     consider a value like `("%s <%s>" name email)'

 -- Variable: eudc-multiple-match-handling-method
     This variable controls what to do when multiple entries match a
     query for an inline expansion.  Possible values are:
    `first'
          The first match is considered as being the only one, the
          others are discarded.

    `select'
          A selection buffer pops up where you can choose a particular
          match.  This is the default value of the variable.

    `all'
          The expansion uses all records successively

    `abort'
          An error is signaled.  The expansion aborts.

     Default is `select'

3.5 The Server Hotlist
======================

EUDC lets you maintain a list of frequently used servers so that you
can easily switch from one to another.  This hotlist appears in the
`Server' submenu.  You select a server in this list by clicking on its
name.  You can add the current server to the list with the command `M-x
eudc-bookmark-current-server'.  The list is contained in the variable
`eudc-server-hotlist' which is stored in and retrieved from the file
designated by `eudc-options-file'.  EUDC also provides a facility to
edit the hotlist interactively (*note The Hotlist Edit Buffer::).

   The hotlist is also used to make queries on multiple servers
successively (*note Multi-server Queries::).  The order in which the
servers are tried is the order they appear in the hotlist, therefore it
is important to sort the hotlist appropriately.

 -- Command: eudc-bookmark-server server
     Add SERVER to the hotlist of servers

 -- Command: eudc-bookmark-current-server
     Add the current server to the hotlist of servers

 -- Variable: eudc-options-file
     The name of a file where EUDC stores its internal variables (the
     hotlist and the current server).  EUDC will try to load that file
     upon initialization so, if you choose a file name different from
     the defaults `~/.eudc-options', be sure to set this variable to
     the appropriate value _before_ EUDC is itself loaded.

 -- Command: eudc-hotlist-select-server
     Bound to `s'.  Select the server the point is on as the current
     directory server for the next queries

 -- Command: eudc-hotlist-transpose-servers
     Bound to `t'.  Bubble up the server the point is on to the top of
     the list

 -- Command: eudc-hotlist-quit-edit
     Bound to `q'.  Save the changes and quit the hotlist edit buffer.
     Use `x' or `M-x kill-buffer' to exit without saving.

3.6 Multi-server Queries
========================

When using inline query expansion (*note Inline Query Expansion::), EUDC
can try to query successively a sequence of directory servers until one
of them successfully finds a match for the query.

 -- Variable: eudc-inline-expansion-servers
     This variable controls which servers are tried and in which order
     when trying to perform an inline query.  Possible values are:
    `current-server'
          Only the current directory server is tried

    `hotlist'
          The servers in the hotlist are tried in order until one finds
          a match for the query or `eudc-max-servers-to-query' is
          reached

    `server-then-hotlist'
          The current server then the servers in the hotlist are tried
          in the order they appear in the hotlist until one of them
          finds a match or `eudc-max-servers-to-query' is reached.
          This is the default.

 -- Variable: eudc-max-servers-to-query
     This variable indicates the maximum number of servers to query when
     performing a multi-server query.  The default, `nil', indicates
     that all available servers should be tried.


File: eudc,  Node: Creating BBDB Records,  Next: Server/Protocol Locals,  Prev: Multi-server Queries,  Up: Usage

3.7 Creating BBDB Records
=========================

With EUDC, you can automatically create BBDB records (*note BBDB:
(bbdb)Top.) from records you get from a directory server.  You do this
by moving point to the appropriate record in a query result display
buffer and invoking the command `M-x
eudc-insert-record-at-point-into-bbdb' with the keyboard binding
`b'(1), or with the menu.  EUDC cannot update an existing BBDB record
and will signal an error if you try to insert a record matching an
existing one.

   It is also possible to export to BBDB the whole batch of records
contained in the directory query result with the command `M-x
eudc-batch-export-records-to-bbdb'.

   Because directory systems may not enforce a strict record format,
local server installations may use different attribute names and have
different ways to organize the information.  Furthermore BBDB has its
own record structure.  For these reasons converting a record from its
external directory format to the BBDB format is a highly customizable
process.

 -- Variable: eudc-bbdb-conversion-alist
     The value of this variable should be a symbol naming an alist
     defining a mapping between BBDB field names onto directory
     attribute names records.  This is a protocol-local variable and is
     initialized upon protocol switch (*note Server/Protocol Locals::).
     The alist is made of cells of the form `(BBDB-FIELD .
     SPEC-OR-LIST)'.  BBDB-FIELD is the name of a field that must be
     defined in your BBDB environment (standard field names are `name',
     `company', `net', `phone', `address' and `notes').  SPEC-OR-LIST
     is either a single mapping specification or a list of mapping
     specifications.  Lists of mapping specifications are valid for the
     `phone' and `address' BBDB fields only. SPECs are actually
     s-expressions which are evaluated as follows:

    a string
          evaluates to itself

    a symbol
          evaluates to the symbol value.  Symbols corresponding to
          directory attribute names present in the record evaluate to
          the value of the field in the record

    a form
          is evaluated as a function.  The argument list may contain
          attribute names which evaluate to the corresponding values in
          the record.  The form evaluation should return something
          appropriate for the particular BBDB-FIELD (see
          `bbdb-create-internal').  `eudc-bbdbify-phone' and
          `eudc-bbdbify-address' are provided as convenience functions
          to parse phones and addresses.

   The default value of the PH-specific value of that variable is
`eudc-ph-bbdb-conversion-alist':

     ((name . name)
      (net . email)
      (address . (eudc-bbdbify-address address "Address"))
      (phone . ((eudc-bbdbify-phone phone "Phone")
                (eudc-bbdbify-phone office_phone "Office Phone"))))

   This means that:

   * the `name' field of the BBDB record gets its value from the `name'
     attribute of the directory record

   * the `net' field of the BBDB record gets its value from the `email'
     attribute of the directory record

   * the `address' field of the BBDB record is obtained by parsing the
     `address' attribute of the directory record with the function
     `eudc-bbdbify-address'

   * two `phone' fields are created (when possible) in the BBDB record.
     The first one has `Phone' for location and its value is obtained by
     parsing the `phone' attribute of the PH/QI record with the function
     `eudc-bbdbify-phone'.  The second one has `Office Phone' for
     location its value is obtained by parsing the `office_phone'
     attribute of the PH/QI record with the function
     `eudc-bbdbify-phone'.

 -- Function: eudc-bbdbify-phone phone location
     This is a convenience function provided for use in
     `eudc-bbdb-conversion-alist'.  It parses PHONE into a vector
     compatible with `bbdb-create-internal'.  PHONE is either a string
     supposedly containing a phone number or a list of such strings
     which are concatenated. LOCATION is used as the phone location for
     BBDB.

 -- Function: eudc-bbdbify-address addr location
     This is a convenience function provided for use in
     `eudc-bbdb-conversion-alist'.  It parses ADDR into a vector
     compatible with `bbdb-create-internal'.  ADDR should be an address
     string of no more than four lines or a list of lines.  The last
     line is searched for the zip code, city and state name.  LOCATION
     is used as the phone location for BBDB.

   Note that only a subset of the attributes you selected with
`eudc-default-return-attributes' and that are actually displayed may
actually be inserted as part of the newly created BBDB record.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This key binding does not actually call
`eudc-insert-record-at-point-into-bbdb' but uses `eudc-try-bbdb-insert'
instead.

3.8 Server/Protocol Locals
==========================

EUDC can be customized independently for each server or directory
protocol.  All variables can be given local bindings that are activated
when a particular server and/or protocol becomes active.  This is much
like buffer-local bindings but on a per server or per protocol basis.

* Menu:

* Manipulating local bindings::  Functions to set and query local bindings


File: eudc,  Node: Manipulating local bindings,  Prev: Server/Protocol Locals,  Up: Server/Protocol Locals

3.8.1 Manipulating local bindings
---------------------------------

EUDC offers functions that let you set and query variables on a per
server or per protocol basis.

   The following predicates allow you to test the existence of
server/protocol local bindings for a particular variable.

 -- Function: eudc-server-local-variable-p var
     Return non-`nil' if VAR has server-local bindings

 -- Function: eudc-protocol-local-variable-p var
     Return non-`nil' if VAR has protocol-local bindings

   The following functions allow you to set the value of a variable with
various degrees of locality.

 -- Function: eudc-default-set var val
     Set the EUDC default value of VAR to VAL.  The current binding of
     VAR (if local to the current server or protocol) is not changed.

 -- Function: eudc-protocol-set var val &optional protocol
     Set the binding of VAR local to PROTOCOL to VAL.  If omitted,
     PROTOCOL defaults to the current value of `eudc-protocol'.  The
     current binding of VAR is changed only if PROTOCOL is omitted.

 -- Function: eudc-server-set var val &optional server
     Set the binding of VAR local to SERVER to VAL.  If omitted, SERVER
     defaults to the current value of `eudc-server'.  The current
     binding of VAR is changed only if SERVER is omitted.

 -- Function: eudc-set var val
     Set the most local (server, protocol or default) binding of VAR to
     VAL.  The current binding of VAR is also set to VAL.

   The following variables allow you to query the various bindings of a
variable (local or non-local).

 -- Function: eudc-variable-default-value var
     Return the default binding of VAR (outside of a particular server
     or protocol local binding).  Return `unbound' if VAR has no EUDC
     default value.

 -- Function: eudc-variable-protocol-value var &optional protocol
     Return the value of VAR local to PROTOCOL.  Return `unbound' if
     VAR has no value local to PROTOCOL.  PROTOCOL defaults to
     `eudc-protocol'.

 -- Function: eudc-variable-server-value var [server]
     Return the value of VAR local to SERVER.  Return `unbound' if VAR
     has no value local to SERVER.  SERVER defaults to `eudc-server'.

   Changing a protocol-local or server-local value of a variable has no
effect on its current value.  The following command is used to
synchronize the current values of variables with their local values
given the current `eudc-server' and `eudc-protocol':

 -- Function: eudc-update-local-variables
     Update all EUDC variables according to their local settings.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
