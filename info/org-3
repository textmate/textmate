15.11 org-crypt.el
==================

Org-crypt will encrypt the text of an entry, but not the headline, or
properties.  Org-crypt uses the Emacs EasyPG library to encrypt and
decrypt files.

   Any text below a headline that has a `:crypt:' tag will be
automatically be encrypted when the file is saved.  If you want to use
a different tag just customize the `org-crypt-tag-matcher' setting.

   To use org-crypt it is suggested that you have the following in your
`.emacs':

     (require 'org-crypt)
     (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
     (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote ("crypt")))

     (setq org-crypt-key nil)
       ;; GPG key to use for encryption
       ;; Either the Key ID or set to nil to use symmetric encryption.

     (setq auto-save-default nil)
       ;; Auto-saving does not cooperate with org-crypt.el: so you need
       ;; to turn it off if you plan to use org-crypt.el quite often.
       ;; Otherwise, you'll get an (annoying) message each time you
       ;; start Org.

       ;; To turn it off only locally, you can insert this:
       ;;
       ;; # -*- buffer-auto-save-file-name: nil; -*-

   Excluding the crypt tag from inheritance prevents already encrypted
text being encrypted again.

A.1 Hooks
=========

Org has a large number of hook variables that can be used to add
functionality.  This appendix about hacking is going to illustrate the
use of some of them.  A complete list of all hooks with documentation is
maintained by the Worg project and can be found at
`http://orgmode.org/worg/org-configs/org-hooks.php'.

A.2 Add-on packages
===================

A large number of add-on packages have been written by various authors.
These packages are not part of Emacs, but they are distributed as
contributed packages with the separate release available at the Org
mode home page at `http://orgmode.org'.  The list of contributed
packages, along with documentation about each package, is maintained by
the Worg project at `http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/'.

A.3 Adding hyperlink types
==========================

Org has a large number of hyperlink types built-in (*note
Hyperlinks::).  If you would like to add new link types, Org provides
an interface for doing so.  Let's look at an example file,
`org-man.el', that will add support for creating links like
`[[man:printf][The printf manpage]]' to show Unix manual pages inside
Emacs:

     ;;; org-man.el - Support for links to manpages in Org

     (require 'org)

     (org-add-link-type "man" 'org-man-open)
     (add-hook 'org-store-link-functions 'org-man-store-link)

     (defcustom org-man-command 'man
       "The Emacs command to be used to display a man page."
       :group 'org-link
       :type '(choice (const man) (const woman)))

     (defun org-man-open (path)
       "Visit the manpage on PATH.
     PATH should be a topic that can be thrown at the man command."
       (funcall org-man-command path))

     (defun org-man-store-link ()
       "Store a link to a manpage."
       (when (memq major-mode '(Man-mode woman-mode))
         ;; This is a man page, we do make this link
         (let* ((page (org-man-get-page-name))
                (link (concat "man:" page))
                (description (format "Manpage for %s" page)))
           (org-store-link-props
            :type "man"
            :link link
            :description description))))

     (defun org-man-get-page-name ()
       "Extract the page name from the buffer name."
       ;; This works for both `Man-mode' and `woman-mode'.
       (if (string-match " \\(\\S-+\\)\\*" (buffer-name))
           (match-string 1 (buffer-name))
         (error "Cannot create link to this man page")))

     (provide 'org-man)

     ;;; org-man.el ends here

You would activate this new link type in `.emacs' with

     (require 'org-man)

Let's go through the file and see what it does.
  1. It does `(require 'org)' to make sure that `org.el' has been
     loaded.

  2. The next line calls `org-add-link-type' to define a new link type
     with prefix `man'.  The call also contains the name of a function
     that will be called to follow such a link.

  3. The next line adds a function to `org-store-link-functions', in
     order to allow the command `C-c l' to record a useful link in a
     buffer displaying a man page.

   The rest of the file defines the necessary variables and functions.
First there is a customization variable that determines which Emacs
command should be used to display man pages.  There are two options,
`man' and `woman'.  Then the function to follow a link is defined.  It
gets the link path as an argument--in this case the link path is just a
topic for the manual command.  The function calls the value of
`org-man-command' to display the man page.

   Finally the function `org-man-store-link' is defined.  When you try
to store a link with `C-c l', this function will be called to try to
make a link.  The function must first decide if it is supposed to
create the link for this buffer type; we do this by checking the value
of the variable `major-mode'.  If not, the function must exit and
return the value `nil'.  If yes, the link is created by getting the
manual topic from the buffer name and prefixing it with the string
`man:'.  Then it must call the command `org-store-link-props' and set
the `:type' and `:link' properties.  Optionally you can also set the
`:description' property to provide a default for the link description
when the link is later inserted into an Org buffer with `C-c C-l'.

   When it makes sense for your new link type, you may also define a
function `org-PREFIX-complete-link' that implements special (e.g.
completion) support for inserting such a link with `C-c C-l'.  Such a
function should not accept any arguments, and return the full link with
prefix.


File: org,  Node: Context-sensitive commands,  Next: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Prev: Adding hyperlink types,  Up: Hacking

A.4 Context-sensitive commands
==============================

Org has several commands that act differently depending on context.
The most important example is the `C-c C-c' (*note The very busy C-c
C-c key::).  Also the `M-cursor' and `M-S-cursor' keys have this
property.

   Add-ons can tap into this functionality by providing a function that
detects special context for that add-on and executes functionality
appropriate for the context.  Here is an example from Dan Davison's
`org-R.el' which allows you to evaluate commands based on the `R'
programming language (1).  For this package, special contexts are lines
that start with `#+R:' or `#+RR:'.

     (defun org-R-apply-maybe ()
       "Detect if this is context for org-R and execute R commands."
       (if (save-excursion
             (beginning-of-line 1)
             (looking-at "#\\+RR?:"))
           (progn (call-interactively 'org-R-apply)
                  t) ;; to signal that we took action
         nil)) ;; to signal that we did not

     (add-hook 'org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook 'org-R-apply-maybe)

   The function first checks if the cursor is in such a line.  If that
is the case, `org-R-apply' is called and the function returns `t' to
signal that action was taken, and `C-c C-c' will stop looking for other
contexts.  If the function finds it should do nothing locally, it
returns `nil' so that other, similar functions can have a try.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) `org-R.el' has been replaced by the Org mode functionality
described in *note Working With Source Code:: and is now obsolete.


File: org,  Node: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Next: Dynamic blocks,  Prev: Context-sensitive commands,  Up: Hacking

A.5 Tables and lists in arbitrary syntax
========================================

Since Orgtbl mode can be used as a minor mode in arbitrary buffers, a
frequent feature request has been to make it work with native tables in
specific languages, for example LaTeX.  However, this is extremely hard
to do in a general way, would lead to a customization nightmare, and
would take away much of the simplicity of the Orgtbl mode table editor.

   This appendix describes a different approach.  We keep the Orgtbl
mode table in its native format (the source table), and use a custom
function to translate the table to the correct syntax, and to install
it in the right location (the target table).  This puts the burden of
writing conversion functions on the user, but it allows for a very
flexible system.

   Bastien added the ability to do the same with lists, in Orgstruct
mode.  You can use Org's facilities to edit and structure lists by
turning `orgstruct-mode' on, then locally exporting such lists in
another format (HTML, LaTeX or Texinfo.)

File: org,  Node: Radio tables,  Next: A LaTeX example,  Prev: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Up: Tables in arbitrary syntax

A.5.1 Radio tables
------------------

To define the location of the target table, you first need to create two
lines that are comments in the current mode, but contain magic words for
Orgtbl mode to find.  Orgtbl mode will insert the translated table
between these lines, replacing whatever was there before.  For example:

     /* BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
     /* END RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */

Just above the source table, we put a special line that tells Orgtbl
mode how to translate this table and where to install it.  For example: 
     #+ORGTBL: SEND table_name translation_function arguments....

`table_name' is the reference name for the table that is also used in
the receiver lines.  `translation_function' is the Lisp function that
does the translation.  Furthermore, the line can contain a list of
arguments (alternating key and value) at the end.  The arguments will be
passed as a property list to the translation function for
interpretation.  A few standard parameters are already recognized and
acted upon before the translation function is called:

`:skip N'
     Skip the first N lines of the table.  Hlines do count as separate
     lines for this parameter!

`:skipcols (n1 n2 ...)'
     List of columns that should be skipped.  If the table has a column
     with calculation marks, that column is automatically discarded as
     well.  Please note that the translator function sees the table
     _after_ the removal of these columns, the function never knows
     that there have been additional columns.

The one problem remaining is how to keep the source table in the buffer
without disturbing the normal workings of the file, for example during
compilation of a C file or processing of a LaTeX file.  There are a
number of different solutions:

   * The table could be placed in a block comment if that is supported
     by the language.  For example, in C mode you could wrap the table
     between `/*' and `*/' lines.

   * Sometimes it is possible to put the table after some kind of END
     statement, for example `\bye' in TeX and `\end{document}' in LaTeX.

   * You can just comment the table line-by-line whenever you want to
     process the file, and uncomment it whenever you need to edit the
     table.  This only sounds tedious--the command `M-x
     orgtbl-toggle-comment' makes this comment-toggling very easy, in
     particular if you bind it to a key.


File: org,  Node: A LaTeX example,  Next: Translator functions,  Prev: Radio tables,  Up: Tables in arbitrary syntax

A.5.2 A LaTeX example of radio tables
-------------------------------------

The best way to wrap the source table in LaTeX is to use the `comment'
environment provided by `comment.sty'.  It has to be activated by
placing `\usepackage{comment}' into the document header.  Orgtbl mode
can insert a radio table skeleton(1)  with the command `M-x
orgtbl-insert-radio-table'.  You will be prompted for a table name,
let's say we use `salesfigures'.  You will then get the following
template:

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | | |
     \end{comment}

The `#+ORGTBL: SEND' line tells Orgtbl mode to use the function
`orgtbl-to-latex' to convert the table into LaTeX and to put it into
the receiver location with name `salesfigures'.  You may now fill in
the table--feel free to use the spreadsheet features(2):

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     % $ (optional extra dollar to keep font-lock happy, see footnote)
     \end{comment}

When you are done, press `C-c C-c' in the table to get the converted
table inserted between the two marker lines.

   Now let's assume you want to make the table header by hand, because
you want to control how columns are aligned, etc.  In this case we make
sure that the table translator skips the first 2 lines of the source
table, and tell the command to work as a splice, i.e. to not produce
header and footer commands of the target table:

     \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
     Month & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Days} & Nr.\ sold & per day\\
     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \end{tabular}
     %
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex :splice t :skip 2
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     \end{comment}

   The LaTeX translator function `orgtbl-to-latex' is already part of
Orgtbl mode.  It uses a `tabular' environment to typeset the table and
marks horizontal lines with `\hline'.  Furthermore, it interprets the
following parameters (see also *note Translator functions::):

`:splice nil/t'
     When set to t, return only table body lines, don't wrap them into a
     tabular environment.  Default is nil.

`:fmt fmt'
     A format to be used to wrap each field, it should contain `%s' for
     the original field value.  For example, to wrap each field value
     in dollars, you could use `:fmt "$%s$"'.  This may also be a
     property list with column numbers and formats, for example `:fmt
     (2 "$%s$" 4 "%s\\%%")'.  A function of one argument can be used in
     place of the strings; the function must return a formatted string.

`:efmt efmt'
     Use this format to print numbers with exponentials.  The format
     should have `%s' twice for inserting mantissa and exponent, for
     example `"%s\\times10^{%s}"'.  The default is `"%s\\,(%s)"'.  This
     may also be a property list with column numbers and formats, for
     example `:efmt (2 "$%s\\times10^{%s}$" 4 "$%s\\cdot10^{%s}$")'.
     After `efmt' has been applied to a value, `fmt' will also be
     applied.  Similar to `fmt', functions of two arguments can be
     supplied instead of strings.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) By default this works only for LaTeX, HTML, and Texinfo.
Configure the variable `orgtbl-radio-tables' to install templates for
other modes.

   (2) If the `#+TBLFM' line contains an odd number of dollar
characters, this may cause problems with font-lock in LaTeX mode.  As
shown in the example you can fix this by adding an extra line inside the
`comment' environment that is used to balance the dollar expressions.
If you are using AUCTeX with the font-latex library, a much better
solution is to add the `comment' environment to the variable
`LaTeX-verbatim-environments'.

A.5.3 Translator functions
--------------------------

Orgtbl mode has several translator functions built-in: `orgtbl-to-csv'
(comma-separated values), `orgtbl-to-tsv' (TAB-separated values)
`orgtbl-to-latex', `orgtbl-to-html', and `orgtbl-to-texinfo'.  Except
for `orgtbl-to-html'(1), these all use a generic translator,
`orgtbl-to-generic'.  For example, `orgtbl-to-latex' itself is a very
short function that computes the column definitions for the `tabular'
environment, defines a few field and line separators and then hands
processing over to the generic translator.  Here is the entire code:

     (defun orgtbl-to-latex (table params)
       "Convert the Orgtbl mode TABLE to LaTeX."
       (let* ((alignment (mapconcat (lambda (x) (if x "r" "l"))
                                    org-table-last-alignment ""))
              (params2
               (list
                :tstart (concat "\\begin{tabular}{" alignment "}")
                :tend "\\end{tabular}"
                :lstart "" :lend " \\\\" :sep " & "
                :efmt "%s\\,(%s)" :hline "\\hline")))
         (orgtbl-to-generic table (org-combine-plists params2 params))))

   As you can see, the properties passed into the function (variable
PARAMS) are combined with the ones newly defined in the function
(variable PARAMS2).  The ones passed into the function (i.e. the ones
set by the `ORGTBL SEND' line) take precedence.  So if you would like
to use the LaTeX translator, but wanted the line endings to be
`\\[2mm]' instead of the default `\\', you could just overrule the
default with

     #+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-latex :lend " \\\\[2mm]"

   For a new language, you can either write your own converter function
in analogy with the LaTeX translator, or you can use the generic
function directly.  For example, if you have a language where a table
is started with `!BTBL!', ended with `!ETBL!', and where table lines are
started with `!BL!', ended with `!EL!', and where the field separator
is a TAB, you could call the generic translator like this (on a single
line!):

     #+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-generic :tstart "!BTBL!" :tend "!ETBL!"
                                   :lstart "!BL! " :lend " !EL!" :sep "\t"

Please check the documentation string of the function
`orgtbl-to-generic' for a full list of parameters understood by that
function, and remember that you can pass each of them into
`orgtbl-to-latex', `orgtbl-to-texinfo', and any other function using
the generic function.

   Of course you can also write a completely new function doing
complicated things the generic translator cannot do.  A translator
function takes two arguments.  The first argument is the table, a list
of lines, each line either the symbol `hline' or a list of fields.  The
second argument is the property list containing all parameters
specified in the `#+ORGTBL: SEND' line.  The function must return a
single string containing the formatted table.  If you write a generally
useful translator, please post it on <emacs-orgmode@gnu.org> so that
others can benefit from your work.

   (1) The HTML translator uses the same code that produces tables
during HTML export.


File: org,  Node: Radio lists,  Prev: Translator functions,  Up: Tables in arbitrary syntax

A.5.4 Radio lists
-----------------

Sending and receiving radio lists works exactly the same way as sending
and receiving radio tables (*note Radio tables::).  As for radio
tables, you can insert radio list templates in HTML, LaTeX and Texinfo
modes by calling `org-list-insert-radio-list'.

   Here are the differences with radio tables:

   - Orgstruct mode must be active.

   - Use the `ORGLST' keyword instead of `ORGTBL'.

   - The available translation functions for radio lists don't take
     parameters.

   - `C-c C-c' will work when pressed on the first item of the list.

   Here is a LaTeX example.  Let's say that you have this in your LaTeX
file:

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
     % END RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGLST: SEND to-buy org-list-to-latex
     - a new house
     - a new computer
       + a new keyboard
       + a new mouse
     - a new life
     \end{comment}

   Pressing `C-c C-c' on `a new house' and will insert the converted
LaTeX list between the two marker lines.


File: org,  Node: Dynamic blocks,  Next: Special agenda views,  Prev: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Up: Hacking

A.6 Dynamic blocks
==================

Org documents can contain _dynamic blocks_.  These are specially marked
regions that are updated by some user-written function.  A good example
for such a block is the clock table inserted by the command `C-c C-x
C-r' (*note Clocking work time::).

   Dynamic blocks are enclosed by a BEGIN-END structure that assigns a
name to the block and can also specify parameters for the function
producing the content of the block.

     #+BEGIN: myblock :parameter1 value1 :parameter2 value2 ...

     #+END:

   Dynamic blocks are updated with the following commands

`C-c C-x C-u     (`org-dblock-update')'
     Update dynamic block at point.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks in the current file.

   Updating a dynamic block means to remove all the text between BEGIN
and END, parse the BEGIN line for parameters and then call the specific
writer function for this block to insert the new content.  If you want
to use the original content in the writer function, you can use the
extra parameter `:content'.

   For a block with name `myblock', the writer function is
`org-dblock-write:myblock' with as only parameter a property list with
the parameters given in the begin line.  Here is a trivial example of a
block that keeps track of when the block update function was last run:

     #+BEGIN: block-update-time :format "on %m/%d/%Y at %H:%M"

     #+END:

The corresponding block writer function could look like this:

     (defun org-dblock-write:block-update-time (params)
        (let ((fmt (or (plist-get params :format) "%d. %m. %Y")))
          (insert "Last block update at: "
                  (format-time-string fmt (current-time)))))

   If you want to make sure that all dynamic blocks are always
up-to-date, you could add the function `org-update-all-dblocks' to a
hook, for example `before-save-hook'.  `org-update-all-dblocks' is
written in a way such that it does nothing in buffers that are not in
`org-mode'.

   You can narrow the current buffer to the current dynamic block (like
any other block) with `org-narrow-to-block'.

A.7 Special agenda views
========================

Org provides a special hook that can be used to narrow down the
selection made by these agenda views: `agenda', `todo', `alltodo',
`tags', `tags-todo', `tags-tree'.  You may specify a function that is
used at each match to verify if the match should indeed be part of the
agenda view, and if not, how much should be skipped.  You can specify a
global condition that will be applied to all agenda views, this
condition would be stored in the variable
`org-agenda-skip-function-global'.  More commonly, such a definition is
applied only to specific custom searches, using
`org-agenda-skip-function'.

   Let's say you want to produce a list of projects that contain a
WAITING tag anywhere in the project tree.  Let's further assume that
you have marked all tree headings that define a project with the TODO
keyword PROJECT.  In this case you would run a TODO search for the
keyword PROJECT, but skip the match unless there is a WAITING tag
anywhere in the subtree belonging to the project line.

   To achieve this, you must write a function that searches the subtree
for the tag.  If the tag is found, the function must return `nil' to
indicate that this match should not be skipped.  If there is no such
tag, return the location of the end of the subtree, to indicate that
search should continue from there.

     (defun my-skip-unless-waiting ()
       "Skip trees that are not waiting"
       (let ((subtree-end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree t))))
         (if (re-search-forward ":waiting:" subtree-end t)
             nil          ; tag found, do not skip
           subtree-end))) ; tag not found, continue after end of subtree

   Now you may use this function in an agenda custom command, for
example like this:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function 'my-skip-unless-waiting)
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

   Note that this also binds `org-agenda-overriding-header' to get a
meaningful header in the agenda view.

   A general way to create custom searches is to base them on a search
for entries with a certain level limit.  If you want to study all
entries with your custom search function, simply do a search for
`LEVEL>0'(1), and then use `org-agenda-skip-function' to select the
entries you really want to have.

   You may also put a Lisp form into `org-agenda-skip-function'.  In
particular, you may use the functions `org-agenda-skip-entry-if' and
`org-agenda-skip-subtree-if' in this form, for example:

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled)'
     Skip current entry if it has been scheduled.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notscheduled)'
     Skip current entry if it has not been scheduled.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'deadline)'
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline)'
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline, or if it is scheduled.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo '("TODO" "WAITING"))'
     Skip current entry if the TODO keyword is TODO or WAITING.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done)'
     Skip current entry if the TODO keyword marks a DONE state.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'timestamp)'
     Skip current entry if it has any timestamp, may also be deadline
     or scheduled.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry 'regexp "regular expression")'
     Skip current entry if the regular expression matches in the entry.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry 'notregexp "regular expression")'
     Skip current entry unless the regular expression matches.

`(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if 'regexp "regular expression")'
     Same as above, but check and skip the entire subtree.

   Therefore we could also have written the search for WAITING projects
like this, even without defining a special function:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if
                                     'regexp ":waiting:"))
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that, when using `org-odd-levels-only', a level number
corresponds to order in the hierarchy, not to the number of stars.

A.8 Extracting agenda information
=================================

Org provides commands to access agenda information for the command line
in Emacs batch mode.  This extracted information can be sent directly
to a printer, or it can be read by a program that does further
processing of the data.  The first of these commands is the function
`org-batch-agenda', that produces an agenda view and sends it as ASCII
text to STDOUT.  The command takes a single string as parameter.  If
the string has length 1, it is used as a key to one of the commands you
have configured in `org-agenda-custom-commands', basically any key you
can use after `C-c a'.  For example, to directly print the current TODO
list, you could use

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda "t")' | lpr

   If the parameter is a string with 2 or more characters, it is used
as a tags/TODO match string.  For example, to print your local shopping
list (all items with the tag `shop', but excluding the tag `NewYork'),
you could use

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
           -eval '(org-batch-agenda "+shop-NewYork")' | lpr

You may also modify parameters on the fly like this:

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
        -eval '(org-batch-agenda "a"                               \
                 org-agenda-span (quote month)                     \
                 org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
                 org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
        | lpr

which will produce a 30-day agenda, fully restricted to the Org file
`~/org/projects.org', not even including the diary.

   If you want to process the agenda data in more sophisticated ways,
you can use the command `org-batch-agenda-csv' to get a comma-separated
list of values for each agenda item.  Each line in the output will
contain a number of fields separated by commas.  The fields in a line
are:

     category     The category of the item
     head         The headline, without TODO keyword, TAGS and PRIORITY
     type         The type of the agenda entry, can be
                     todo               selected in TODO match
                     tagsmatch          selected in tags match
                     diary              imported from diary
                     deadline           a deadline
                     scheduled          scheduled
                     timestamp          appointment, selected by timestamp
                     closed             entry was closed on date
                     upcoming-deadline  warning about nearing deadline
                     past-scheduled     forwarded scheduled item
                     block              entry has date block including date
     todo         The TODO keyword, if any
     tags         All tags including inherited ones, separated by colons
     date         The relevant date, like 2007-2-14
     time         The time, like 15:00-16:50
     extra        String with extra planning info
     priority-l   The priority letter if any was given
     priority-n   The computed numerical priority

Time and date will only be given if a timestamp (or deadline/scheduled)
led to the selection of the item.

   A CSV list like this is very easy to use in a post-processing script.
For example, here is a Perl program that gets the TODO list from
Emacs/Org and prints all the items, preceded by a checkbox:

     #!/usr/bin/perl

     # define the Emacs command to run
     $cmd = "emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda-csv \"t\")'";

     # run it and capture the output
     $agenda = qx{$cmd 2>/dev/null};

     # loop over all lines
     foreach $line (split(/\n/,$agenda)) {
       # get the individual values
       ($category,$head,$type,$todo,$tags,$date,$time,$extra,
        $priority_l,$priority_n) = split(/,/,$line);
       # process and print
       print "[ ] $head\n";
     }


File: org,  Node: Using the property API,  Next: Using the mapping API,  Prev: Extracting agenda information,  Up: Hacking

A.9 Using the property API
==========================

Here is a description of the functions that can be used to work with
properties.

 -- Function: org-entry-properties &optional pom which
     Get all properties of the entry at point-or-marker POM.
     This includes the TODO keyword, the tags, time strings for
     deadline, scheduled, and clocking, and any additional properties
     defined in the entry.  The return value is an alist.  Keys may
     occur multiple times if the property key was used several times.
     POM may also be nil, in which case the current entry is used.  If
     WHICH is nil or `all', get all properties.  If WHICH is `special'
     or `standard', only get that subclass.
   
 -- Function: org-entry-get pom property &optional inherit
     Get value of PROPERTY for entry at point-or-marker POM.  By
     default, this only looks at properties defined locally in the
     entry.  If INHERIT is non-nil and the entry does not have the
     property, then also check higher levels of the hierarchy.  If
     INHERIT is the symbol `selective', use inheritance if and only if
     the setting of `org-use-property-inheritance' selects PROPERTY for
     inheritance.

 -- Function: org-entry-delete pom property
     Delete the property PROPERTY from entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-entry-put pom property value
     Set PROPERTY to VALUE for entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-buffer-property-keys &optional include-specials
     Get all property keys in the current buffer.

 -- Function: org-insert-property-drawer
     Insert a property drawer at point.

 -- Function: org-entry-put-multivalued-property pom property &rest
          values
     Set PROPERTY at point-or-marker POM to VALUES.  VALUES should be a
     list of strings.  They will be concatenated, with spaces as
     separators.

 -- Function: org-entry-get-multivalued-property pom property
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and return the values as a list of strings.

 -- Function: org-entry-add-to-multivalued-property pom property value
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and make sure that VALUE is in this list.

 -- Function: org-entry-remove-from-multivalued-property pom property
          value
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and make sure that VALUE is _not_ in this list.

 -- Function: org-entry-member-in-multivalued-property pom property
          value
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and check if VALUE is in this list.

 -- User Option: org-property-allowed-value-functions
     Hook for functions supplying allowed values for a specific
     property.  The functions must take a single argument, the name of
     the property, and return a flat list of allowed values.  If `:ETC'
     is one of the values, use the values as completion help, but allow
     also other values to be entered.  The functions must return `nil'
     if they are not responsible for this property.


File: org,  Node: Using the mapping API,  Prev: Using the property API,  Up: Hacking

A.10 Using the mapping API
==========================

Org has sophisticated mapping capabilities to find all entries
satisfying certain criteria.  Internally, this functionality is used to
produce agenda views, but there is also an API that can be used to
execute arbitrary functions for each or selected entries.  The main
entry point for this API is:

 -- Function: org-map-entries func &optional match scope &rest skip
     Call FUNC at each headline selected by MATCH in SCOPE.

     FUNC is a function or a Lisp form.  The function will be called
     without arguments, with the cursor positioned at the beginning of
     the headline.  The return values of all calls to the function will
     be collected and returned as a list.

     The call to FUNC will be wrapped into a save-excursion form, so
     FUNC does not need to preserve point.  After evaluation, the
     cursor will be moved to the end of the line (presumably of the
     headline of the processed entry) and search continues from there.
     Under some circumstances, this may not produce the wanted results.
     For example, if you have removed (e.g. archived) the current
     (sub)tree it could mean that the next entry will be skipped
     entirely.  In such cases, you can specify the position from where
     search should continue by making FUNC set the variable
     `org-map-continue-from' to the desired buffer position.

     MATCH is a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda
     match view.  Only headlines that are matched by this query will be
     considered during the iteration.  When MATCH is nil or t, all
     headlines will be visited by the iteration.

     SCOPE determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:

          nil     the current buffer, respecting the restriction if any
          tree    the subtree started with the entry at point
          region  The entries within the active region, if any
          file    the current buffer, without restriction
          file-with-archives
                  the current buffer, and any archives associated with it
          agenda  all agenda files
          agenda-with-archives
                  all agenda files with any archive files associated with them
          (file1 file2 ...)
                  if this is a list, all files in the list will be scanned
     The remaining args are treated as settings for the skipping
     facilities of the scanner.  The following items can be given here:

          archive   skip trees with the archive tag
          comment   skip trees with the COMMENT keyword
          function or Lisp form
                    will be used as value for `org-agenda-skip-function',
                    so whenever the function returns t, FUNC
                    will not be called for that entry and search will
                    continue from the point where the function leaves it

   The function given to that mapping routine can really do anything
you like.  It can use the property API (*note Using the property API::)
to gather more information about the entry, or in order to change
metadata in the entry.  Here are a couple of functions that might be
handy:

 -- Function: org-todo &optional arg
     Change the TODO state of the entry.  See the docstring of the
     functions for the many possible values for the argument ARG.

 -- Function: org-priority &optional action
     Change the priority of the entry.  See the docstring of this
     function for the possible values for ACTION.

 -- Function: org-toggle-tag tag &optional onoff
     Toggle the tag TAG in the current entry.  Setting ONOFF to either
     `on' or `off' will not toggle tag, but ensure that it is either on
     or off.

 -- Function: org-promote
     Promote the current entry.

 -- Function: org-demote
     Demote the current entry.

   Here is a simple example that will turn all entries in the current
file with a tag `TOMORROW' into TODO entries with the keyword
`UPCOMING'.  Entries in comment trees and in archive trees will be
ignored.

     (org-map-entries
        '(org-todo "UPCOMING")
        "+TOMORROW" 'file 'archive 'comment)

   The following example counts the number of entries with TODO keyword
`WAITING', in all agenda files.

     (length (org-map-entries t "/+WAITING" 'agenda))

Appendix B MobileOrg
********************

MobileOrg (http://mobileorg.ncogni.to/) is an application for the
iPhone/iPod Touch series of devices, developed by Richard Moreland.
MobileOrg offers offline viewing and capture support for an Org mode
system rooted on a "real" computer.  It does also allow you to record
changes to existing entries.  Android users should check out MobileOrg
Android (http://wiki.github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android/) by Matt
Jones.

   This appendix describes the support Org has for creating agenda
views in a format that can be displayed by MobileOrg, and for
integrating notes captured and changes made by MobileOrg into the main
system.

   For changing tags and TODO states in MobileOrg, you should have set
up the customization variables `org-todo-keywords' and `org-tags-alist'
to cover all important tags and TODO keywords, even if individual files
use only part of these.  MobileOrg will also offer you states and tags
set up with in-buffer settings, but it will understand the logistics of
TODO state sets (*note Per-file keywords::) and mutually exclusive tags
(*note Setting tags::) only for those set in these variables.

File: org,  Node: Setting up the staging area,  Next: Pushing to MobileOrg,  Prev: MobileOrg,  Up: MobileOrg

B.1 Setting up the staging area
===============================

MobileOrg needs to interact with Emacs through a directory on a server.
If you are using a public server, you should consider to encrypt the
files that are uploaded to the server.  This can be done with Org mode
7.02 and with MobileOrg 1.5 (iPhone version), and you need an `openssl'
installation on your system.  To turn on encryption, set a password in
MobileOrg and, on the Emacs side, configure the variable
`org-mobile-use-encryption'(1).

   The easiest way to create that directory is to use a free
Dropbox.com (http://dropbox.com) account(2).  When MobileOrg first
connects to your Dropbox, it will create a directory MobileOrg inside
the Dropbox.  After the directory has been created, tell Emacs about it:

     (setq org-mobile-directory "~/Dropbox/MobileOrg")

   Org mode has commands to put files for MobileOrg into that directory,
and to read captured notes from there.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you can safely store the password in your Emacs setup, you
might also want to configure `org-mobile-encryption-password'.  Please
read the docstring of that variable.  Note that encryption will apply
only to the contents of the `.org' files.  The file names themselves
will remain visible.

   (2) If you cannot use Dropbox, or if your version of MobileOrg does
not support it, you can use a webdav server.  For more information,
check out the documentation of MobileOrg and also this FAQ entry
(http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#mobileorg_webdav).


File: org,  Node: Pushing to MobileOrg,  Next: Pulling from MobileOrg,  Prev: Setting up the staging area,  Up: MobileOrg

B.2 Pushing to MobileOrg
========================

This operation copies all files currently listed in `org-mobile-files'
to the directory `org-mobile-directory'.  By default this list contains
all agenda files (as listed in `org-agenda-files'), but additional files
can be included by customizing `org-mobile-files'.  File names will be
staged with paths relative to `org-directory', so all files should be
inside this directory.  The push operation also creates a special Org
file `agendas.org' with all custom agenda view defined by the user(1).
Finally, Org writes the file `index.org', containing links to all other
files.  MobileOrg first reads this file from the server, and then
downloads all agendas and Org files listed in it.  To speed up the
download, MobileOrg will only read files whose checksums(2) have
changed.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) While creating the agendas, Org mode will force ID properties on
all referenced entries, so that these entries can be uniquely identified
if MobileOrg flags them for further action.  If you do not want to get
these properties in so many entries, you can set the variable
`org-mobile-force-id-on-agenda-items' to `nil'.  Org mode will then
rely on outline paths, in the hope that these will be unique enough.

   (2) stored automatically in the file `checksums.dat'


File: org,  Node: Pulling from MobileOrg,  Prev: Pushing to MobileOrg,  Up: MobileOrg

B.3 Pulling from MobileOrg
==========================

When MobileOrg synchronizes with the server, it not only pulls the Org
files for viewing.  It also appends captured entries and pointers to
flagged and changed entries to the file `mobileorg.org' on the server.
Org has a _pull_ operation that integrates this information into an
inbox file and operates on the pointers to flagged entries.  Here is
how it works:

  1. Org moves all entries found in `mobileorg.org'(1) and appends them
     to the file pointed to by the variable
     `org-mobile-inbox-for-pull'.  Each captured entry and each editing
     event will be a top-level entry in the inbox file.

  2. After moving the entries, Org will attempt to implement the
     changes made in MobileOrg.  Some changes are applied directly and
     without user interaction.  Examples are all changes to tags, TODO
     state, headline and body text that can be cleanly applied.
     Entries that have been flagged for further action will receive a
     tag `:FLAGGED:', so that they can be easily found again.  When
     there is a problem finding an entry or applying the change, the
     pointer entry will remain in the inbox and will be marked with an
     error message.  You need to later resolve these issues by hand.

  3. Org will then generate an agenda view with all flagged entries.
     The user should then go through these entries and do whatever
     actions are necessary.  If a note has been stored while flagging
     an entry in MobileOrg, that note will be displayed in the echo
     area when the cursor is on the corresponding agenda line.
    `?'
          Pressing `?' in that special agenda will display the full
          flagging note in another window and also push it onto the
          kill ring.  So you could use `?  z C-y C-c C-c' to store that
          flagging note as a normal note in the entry.  Pressing `?'
          twice in succession will offer to remove the `:FLAGGED:' tag
          along with the recorded flagging note (which is stored in a
          property).  In this way you indicate that the intended
          processing for this flagged entry is finished.

   If you are not able to process all flagged entries directly, you can
always return to this agenda view(2) using `C-c a ?'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) `mobileorg.org' will be empty after this operation.

   (2) Note, however, that there is a subtle difference.  The view
created automatically by `M-x org-mobile-pull <RET>' is guaranteed to
search all files that have been addressed by the last pull.  This might
include a file that is not currently in your list of agenda files.  If
you later use `C-c a ?' to regenerate the view, only the current agenda
files will be searched.

Appendix C History and acknowledgments
**************************************

Org was born in 2003, out of frustration over the user interface of the
Emacs Outline mode.  I was trying to organize my notes and projects,
and using Emacs seemed to be the natural way to go.  However, having to
remember eleven different commands with two or three keys per command,
only to hide and show parts of the outline tree, that seemed entirely
unacceptable to me.  Also, when using outlines to take notes, I
constantly wanted to restructure the tree, organizing it parallel to my
thoughts and plans.  _Visibility cycling_ and _structure editing_ were
originally implemented in the package `outline-magic.el', but quickly
moved to the more general `org.el'.  As this environment became
comfortable for project planning, the next step was adding _TODO
entries_, basic _timestamps_, and _table support_.  These areas
highlighted the two main goals that Org still has today: to be a new,
outline-based, plain text mode with innovative and intuitive editing
features, and to incorporate project planning functionality directly
into a notes file.

   Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me or to
<emacs-orgmode@gnu.org> have provided a constant stream of bug reports,
feedback, new ideas, and sometimes patches and add-on code.  Many
thanks to everyone who has helped to improve this package.  I am trying
to keep here a list of the people who had significant influence in
shaping one or more aspects of Org.  The list may not be complete, if I
have forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and let me know.

   Before I get to this list, a few special mentions are in order:

Bastien Guerry
     Bastien has written a large number of extensions to Org (most of
     them integrated into the core by now), including the LaTeX
     exporter and the plain list parser.  His support during the early
     days, when he basically acted as co-maintainer, was central to the
     success of this project.  Bastien also invented Worg, helped
     establishing the Web presence of Org, and sponsors hosting costs
     for the orgmode.org website.

Eric Schulte and Dan Davison
     Eric and Dan are jointly responsible for the Org-babel system,
     which turns Org into a multi-language environment for evaluating
     code and doing literate programming and reproducible research.

John Wiegley
     John has contributed a number of great ideas and patches directly
     to Org, including the attachment system (`org-attach.el'),
     integration with Apple Mail (`org-mac-message.el'), hierarchical
     dependencies of TODO items, habit tracking (`org-habits.el'), and
     encryption (`org-crypt.el').  Also, the capture system is really
     an extended copy of his great `remember.el'.

Sebastian Rose
     Without Sebastian, the HTML/XHTML publishing of Org would be the
     pitiful work of an ignorant amateur.  Sebastian has pushed this
     part of Org onto a much higher level.  He also wrote
     `org-info.js', a Java script for displaying webpages derived from
     Org using an Info-like or a folding interface with single-key
     navigation.
