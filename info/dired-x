1.1 Features
============

Some features provided by Dired Extra:

  1. Omitting uninteresting files from Dired listing (*note Omitting
     Files in Dired::).

  2. Guessing shell commands in Dired buffers (*note Shell Command
     Guessing::).

  3. Running Dired command in non-Dired buffers (*note Virtual Dired::).

  4. Finding a file mentioned in a buffer (*note Find File At Point::).

  5. Commands using file marking (*note Advanced Mark Commands::).

`dired-x.el' binds some functions to keys in Dired Mode (*note Key
Index::) and also binds `C-x C-j' and `C-x 4 C-j' _globally_ to
`dired-jump' (*note Miscellaneous Commands::).  Optionally, it also
binds `C-x C-f' and `C-x 4 C-f' to `dired-x-find-file' and
`dired-x-find-file-other-window', respectively (*note Find File At
Point::).

1.2 Technical Details
=====================

When `dired-x.el' is loaded, some standard Dired functions from
`dired.el' and `dired-aux.el' offer additional features.
`dired-add-entry' obeys Dired Omit mode (*note Omitting Files in
Dired::), if it is active.  `dired-find-buffer-nocreate' and
`dired-initial-position' respect the value of `dired-find-subdir'
(*note Miscellaneous Commands::).  `dired-clean-up-after-deletion'
respects the value of `dired-clean-up-buffers-too'.
`dired-read-shell-command' uses `dired-guess-shell-command' (*note
Shell Command Guessing::) to offer a smarter default command.

2 Installation
**************

This manual describes the Dired features provided by the file
`dired-x.el'.  To take advantage of these features, you must load the
file and (optionally) set some variables.

In your `~/.emacs' file, or in the system-wide initialization file
`default.el' in the `site-lisp' directory, put

     (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (load "dired-x")
                 ;; Set dired-x global variables here.  For example:
                 ;; (setq dired-guess-shell-gnutar "gtar")
                 ;; (setq dired-x-hands-off-my-keys nil)
                 ))
     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 ;; Set dired-x buffer-local variables here.  For example:
                 ;; (dired-omit-mode 1)
                 ))

This will load `dired-x.el' when Dired is first invoked (for example,
when you first type `C-x d').

2.1 Optional Installation Dired Jump
====================================

In order to have `dired-jump' and `dired-jump-other-window' (*note
Miscellaneous Commands::) work _before_ `dired' and `dired-x' have been
properly loaded you should set-up an autoload for these functions.  In
your `.emacs' file put

     (autoload 'dired-jump "dired-x"
       "Jump to Dired buffer corresponding to current buffer." t)

     (autoload 'dired-jump-other-window "dired-x"
       "Like \\[dired-jump] (dired-jump) but in other window." t)

     (define-key global-map "\C-x\C-j" 'dired-jump)
     (define-key global-map "\C-x4\C-j" 'dired-jump-other-window)

2.2 Optional Installation File At Point
=======================================

If you choose to have `dired-x.el' bind `dired-x-find-file' over
`find-file' (*note Find File At Point::), then you will need to set
`dired-x-hands-off-my-keys'.  To do this, either set it _before_
`dired-x.el' is loaded, or use `M-x customize-variable', or call
`dired-x-bind-find-file' after changing the value.

     (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
               (lambda ()
                 ;; Bind dired-x-find-file.
                 (setq dired-x-hands-off-my-keys nil)
                 (load "dired-x")
                 ))

3 Omitting Files in Dired
*************************

"Omitting" a file means removing it from the directory listing.
Omitting is useful for keeping Dired buffers free of "uninteresting"
files (for instance, auto-save, auxiliary, backup, and revision control
files) so that the user can concentrate on the interesting files.  Like
hidden files, omitted files are never seen by Dired.  Omitting differs
from hiding in several respects:

   * Omitting works on individual files, not on directories; an entire
     directory cannot be omitted (though each of its files could be).

   * Omitting is wholesale; if omitting is turned on for a Dired
     buffer, then all uninteresting files listed in that buffer are
     omitted.  The user does not omit (or unomit) files one at a time.

   * Omitting can be automatic; uninteresting file lines in the buffer
     can be removed before the user ever sees them.

   * Marked files are never omitted.

`M-o'
     (`dired-omit-mode') Toggle between displaying and omitting
     "uninteresting" files.

`* O'
     (`dired-mark-omitted') Mark "uninteresting" files.

In order to make Dired Omit work you first need to load `dired-x.el'
inside `dired-load-hook' (*note Installation::) and then evaluate
`(dired-omit-mode 1)' in some way (*note Omitting Variables::).

* Menu:

* Omitting Variables::
* Omitting Examples::
* Omitting Technical::


File: dired-x,  Node: Omitting Variables,  Next: Omitting Examples,  Up: Omitting Files in Dired

3.1 Omitting Variables
======================

The following variables can be used to customize omitting.

`dired-omit-mode'
     Default: `nil'

     If non-`nil', "uninteresting" files are not listed.  Uninteresting
     files are those whose files whose names match regexp
     `dired-omit-files', plus those ending with extensions in
     `dired-omit-extensions'.  `M-o' (`dired-omit-mode') toggles its
     value, which is buffer-local.  Put

          (dired-omit-mode 1)

     inside your `dired-mode-hook' to have omitting initially turned on
     in _every_ Dired buffer (*note Installation::).  You can then use
     `M-o' to unomit in that buffer.

     To enable omitting automatically only in certain directories you
     can add a directory local setting (*note Directory Variables:
     (emacs)Directory Variables.) for Dired mode

          ((dired-mode . ((dired-omit-mode . t))))

     to a `.dir-locals.el' file in that directory.  You can use the
     command `add-dir-local-variable' to do this.

`dired-omit-files'
     Default: `"^#\\|\\.$"'

     Files whose names match this buffer-local regexp will not be
     displayed.  This only has effect when `dired-omit-mode''s value is
     `t'.

     The default value omits the special directories `.' and `..'  and
     autosave files (plus other files ending in `.') (*note Omitting
     Examples::).

`dired-omit-extensions'
     Default: The elements of `completion-ignored-extensions',
     `dired-latex-unclean-extensions', `dired-bibtex-unclean-extensions'
     and `dired-texinfo-unclean-extensions'.

     If non-`nil', a list of extensions (strings) to omit from Dired
     listings.  Its format is the same as that of
     `completion-ignored-extensions'.

`dired-omit-localp'
     Default:  `no-dir'

     The LOCALP argument `dired-omit-expunge' passes to
     `dired-get-filename'.  If it is `no-dir', omitting is much faster,
     but you can only match against the non-directory part of the file
     name.  Set it to `nil' if you need to match the whole file name or
     `t' to match the file name relative to the buffer's top-level
     directory.

`dired-omit-marker-char'
     Default: `C-o'

     Temporary marker used by Dired to implement omitting.  Should
     never be used as marker by the user or other packages.  There is
     one exception to this rule: by adding

          (setq dired-mark-keys "\C-o")
          ;; i.e., the value of dired-omit-marker-char
          ;; (which is not defined yet)

     to your `~/.emacs', you can bind the `C-o' key to insert a `C-o'
     marker, thus causing these files to be omitted in addition to the
     usually omitted files.  Unfortunately the files you omitted
     manually this way will show up again after reverting the buffer,
     unlike the others.

3.2 Examples of Omitting Various File Types
===========================================

   * If you wish to avoid seeing RCS files and the `RCS' directory,
     then put

          (setq dired-omit-files
                (concat dired-omit-files "\\|^RCS$\\|,v$"))

     in the `dired-load-hook' (*note Installation::).  This assumes
     `dired-omit-localp' has its default value of `no-dir' to make the
     `^'-anchored matches work.  As a slower alternative, with
     `dired-omit-localp' set to `nil', you can use `/' instead of `^'
     in the regexp.

   * If you use `tib', the bibliography program for use with TeX and
     LaTeX, and you want to omit the `INDEX' and the `*-t.tex' files,
     then put

          (setq dired-omit-files
                (concat dired-omit-files "\\|^INDEX$\\|-t\\.tex$"))

     in the `dired-load-hook' (*note Installation::).

   * If you do not wish to see `dot' files (files starting with a `.'),
     then put

          (setq dired-omit-files
                (concat dired-omit-files "\\|^\\..+$"))

     in the `dired-load-hook' (*note Installation::).  (Of course, a
     better way to achieve this particular goal is simply to omit `-a'
     from `dired-listing-switches'.)

3.3 Some Technical Details of Omitting
======================================

Loading `dired-x.el' will install Dired Omit by putting
`dired-omit-expunge' on your `dired-after-readin-hook', and will call
`dired-extra-startup', which in turn calls `dired-omit-startup' in your
`dired-mode-hook'.

4 Local Variables for Dired Directories
***************************************

This Dired-X feature is obsolete as of Emacs 24.1.  The standard Emacs
directory local variables mechanism (*note Directory Variables:
(emacs)Directory Variables.) replaces it.  For an example of the new
mechanisms, *note Omitting Variables::.

   When Dired visits a directory, it looks for a file whose name is the
value of variable `dired-local-variables-file' (default: `.dired').  If
such a file is found, Dired will temporarily insert it into the Dired
buffer and run `hack-local-variables'.

For example, if the user puts

     Local Variables:
     dired-actual-switches: "-lat"
     dired-omit-mode: t
     End:

into a file called `.dired' in a directory then when that directory is
viewed it will be

  1. sorted by date

  2. omitted automatically

You can set `dired-local-variables-file' to `nil' to suppress this.
The value of `dired-enable-local-variables' controls if and how these
local variables are read.  This variable exists so that it may override
the default value of `enable-local-variables'.

Please see the GNU Emacs Manual to learn more about local variables.
*Note Local Variables in Files: (emacs)File Variables.

The following variables affect Dired Local Variables

`dired-local-variables-file'
     Default: `".dired"'

     If non-`nil', file name for local variables for Dired.  If Dired
     finds a file with that name in the current directory, it will
     temporarily insert it into the Dired buffer and run
     `hack-local-variables'.

`dired-enable-local-variables'
     Default: `t'

     Controls the use of local-variables lists in Dired.  This variable
     temporarily overrides the value of `enable-local-variables' when
     the Dired Local Variables are hacked.  It takes the same values as
     that variable.  A value of `nil' means to ignore any Dired Local
     Variables.


File: dired-x,  Node: Shell Command Guessing,  Next: Virtual Dired,  Prev: Local Variables,  Up: Top

5 Shell Command Guessing
************************

Based upon the name of a file, Dired tries to guess what shell command
you might want to apply to it.  For example, if you have point on a
file named `foo.tar' and you press `!', Dired will guess you want to
`tar xvf' it and suggest that as the default shell command.

   The default is mentioned in brackets and you can type `M-n' to get
the default into the minibuffer and then edit it, e.g., to change `tar
xvf' to `tar tvf'.  If there are several commands for a given file,
e.g., `xtex' and `dvips' for a `.dvi' file, you can type `M-n' several
times to see each of the matching commands.

   Dired only tries to guess a command for a single file, never for a
list of marked files.

`dired-guess-shell-alist-default'
     Predefined rules for shell commands.  Set this to `nil' to turn
     guessing off.  The elements of `dired-guess-shell-alist-user'
     (defined by the user) will override these rules.

`dired-guess-shell-alist-user'
     If non-`nil', a user-defined alist of file regexps and their
     suggested commands.  These rules take precedence over the
     predefined rules in the variable `dired-guess-shell-alist-default'
     (to which they are prepended) when `dired-do-shell-command' is
     run).

     Each element of the alist looks like

          (REGEXP COMMAND...)

     where each COMMAND can either be a string or a Lisp expression
     that evaluates to a string.  If several commands are given, all of
     them will temporarily be pushed onto the history.

     If `*' in the shell command, that means to substitute the file
     name.

     You can set this variable in your `~/.emacs'.  For example, to add
     rules for `.foo' and `.bar' file extensions, write

          (setq dired-guess-shell-alist-user
                (list
                 (list "\\.foo$" "FOO-COMMAND");; fixed rule
                 ;; possibly more rules...
                 (list "\\.bar$";; rule with condition test
                        '(if CONDITION
                             "BAR-COMMAND-1"
                           "BAR-COMMAND-2"))))

     This will override any predefined rules for the same extensions.

`dired-guess-shell-case-fold-search'
     Default: `t'

     Non-`nil' means `dired-guess-shell-alist-default' and
     `dired-guess-shell-alist-user' are matched case-insensitively.

`dired-guess-shell-gnutar'
     Default: `nil'

     If non-`nil', this is the name of the GNU Tar executable (e.g.,
     `tar' or `gnutar').  GNU Tar's `z' switch is used for compressed
     tar files.  If you don't have GNU tar, set this to `nil': a pipe
     using `zcat' is then used.

`dired-guess-shell-gzip-quiet'
     Default: `t'

     A non-`nil' value means that `-q' is passed to `gzip' overriding a
     verbose option in the `GZIP' environment variable.

`dired-guess-shell-znew-switches nil'
     Default: `nil'

     A string of switches passed to `znew'.  An example is `-K' which
     will make `znew' keep a `.Z' file when it is smaller than the
     `.gz' file.

`dired-shell-command-history nil'
     History list for commands that read dired-shell commands.

6 Virtual Dired
***************

Using "Virtual Dired" means putting a buffer with Dired-like contents
in Dired mode.  The files described by the buffer contents need not
actually exist.  This is useful if you want to peruse an `ls -lR'
output file, for example one you got from an FTP server.  You can use
all motion commands usually available in Dired.  You can also use it to
save a Dired buffer in a file and resume it in a later session.

   Type `M-x dired-virtual' to put the current buffer into virtual
Dired mode.  You will be prompted for the top level directory of this
buffer, with a default value guessed from the buffer contents.  To
convert the virtual to a real Dired buffer again, type `g' (which calls
`dired-virtual-revert') in the virtual Dired buffer and answer `y'.
You don't have to do this, though: you can relist single subdirectories
using `l' (`dired-do-redisplay') on the subdirectory headerline,
leaving the buffer in virtual Dired mode all the time.

   The function `dired-virtual-mode' is specially designed to turn on
virtual Dired mode from the `auto-mode-alist'.  To edit all `*.dired'
files automatically in virtual Dired mode, put this into your
`~/.emacs':

     (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("[^/]\\.dired$" . dired-virtual-mode)
                                   auto-mode-alist))

The regexp is a bit more complicated than usual to exclude `.dired'
local-variable files.

7 Advanced Mark Commands
************************

`F'
     (`dired-do-find-marked-files') Find all marked files at once
     displaying them simultaneously.  If optional NOSELECT is non-`nil'
     then just find the files but do not select.  If you want to keep
     the Dired buffer displayed, type `C-x 2' first.  If you want just
     the marked files displayed and nothing else, type `C-x 1' first.

     The current window is split across all files marked, as evenly as
     possible.  Remaining lines go to the bottom-most window.  The
     number of files that can be displayed this way is restricted by
     the height of the current window and the variable
     `window-min-height'.

`dired-mark-extension'
     Mark all files with a certain extension for use in later commands.
     A `.' is not automatically prepended to the string entered, you
     must type it explicitly.

     When called from Lisp, EXTENSION may also be a list of extensions
     and an optional argument MARKER-CHAR specifies the marker used.

`dired-flag-extension'
     Flag all files with a certain extension for deletion.  A `.' is
     _not_ automatically prepended to the string entered.

     (`dired-mark-sexp') Mark files for which PREDICATE returns
     non-`nil'.  With a prefix argument, unflag those files instead.

     The PREDICATE is a Lisp expression that can refer to the following
     symbols:
    `inode'
          [integer] the inode of the file (only for `ls -i' output)

    `s'
          [integer] the size of the file for `ls -s' output (usually in
          blocks or, with `-k', in KBytes)

    `mode'
          [string]  file permission bits, e.g., `-rw-r--r--'

    `nlink'
          [integer] number of links to file

    `uid'
          [string]  owner

    `gid'
          [string]  group  (If the gid is not displayed by `ls', this
          will still be set (to the same as uid))

    `size'
          [integer] file size in bytes

    `time'
          [string]  the time that `ls' displays, e.g., `Feb 12 14:17'

    `name'
          [string]  the name of the file

    `sym'
          [string]  if file is a symbolic link, the linked-to name,
          else `""'

     For example, use
          (equal 0 size)
     to mark all zero length files.

     To find out all not yet compiled Emacs Lisp files in a directory,
     Dired all `.el' files in the lisp directory using the wildcard
     `*.el'.  Then use `M-(' with
          (not (file-exists-p (concat name "c")))
     to mark all `.el' files without a corresponding `.elc' file.

8 Multiple Dired Directories and Non-Dired Commands
***************************************************

An Emacs buffer can have but one working directory, stored in the
buffer-local variable `default-directory'.  A Dired buffer may have
several subdirectories inserted, but it still has only one working
directory: that of the top-level Dired directory in that buffer.  For
some commands it is appropriate that they use the current Dired
directory instead of `default-directory', e.g., `find-file' and
`compile'.

   The command `dired-smart-shell-command', bound to `M-!' in Dired
buffers, is like `shell-command', but it runs with `default-directory'
bound to the current Dired directory.


File: dired-x,  Node: Find File At Point,  Next: Miscellaneous Commands,  Prev: Multiple Dired Directories,  Up: Top

8.1 Find File At Point
======================

`dired-x' provides a method of visiting or editing a file mentioned in
the buffer you are viewing (e.g., a mail buffer, a news article, a
`README' file, etc.) or to test if that file exists.  You can then
modify this in the minibuffer after snatching the file name.

   When installed `dired-x' will substitute `dired-x-find-file' for
`find-file' (normally bound to `C-x C-f') and
`dired-x-find-file-other-window' for `find-file-other-window' (normally
bound to `C-x 4 C-f').

   In order to use this feature, you will need to set
`dired-x-hands-off-my-keys' to `nil' inside `dired-load-hook' (*note
Optional Installation File At Point::).

`dired-x-find-file'
     `dired-x-find-file' behaves exactly like `find-file' (normally
     bound to `C-x C-f') unless a prefix argument is passed to the
     function in which case it will use the file name at point as a
     guess for the file to visit.

     For example, if the buffer you were reading contained the words

          Available via anonymous ftp in

             /roebling.poly.edu:/pub/lisp/crypt++.el.gz

     then you could move your cursor to the line containing the ftp
     address and type `C-u C-x C-f' (the `C-u' is a universal
     argument).  The minibuffer would read

          Find file: /roebling.poly.edu:/pub/lisp/crypt++.el.gz

     with the point after the last `/'.  If you hit <RET>, emacs will
     visit the file at that address.  This also works with files on
     your own computer.

`dired-x-find-file-other-window'
     `dired-x-find-file-other-window' behaves exactly like
     `find-file-other-window' (normally bound to `C-x 4 C-f') unless a
     prefix argument is used.  See `dired-x-find-file' for more
     information.

`dired-x-hands-off-my-keys'
     If set to `t', then it means that `dired-x' should _not_ bind
     `dired-x-find-file' over `find-file' on keyboard.  Similarly, it
     should not bind `dired-x-find-file-other-window' over
     `find-file-other-window'.  If you change this variable after
     `dired-x.el' is loaded then do `M-x dired-x-bind-find-file'.  The
     default value of this variable is `t'; by default, the binding is
     not done.  See *Note Optional Installation File At Point::.

`dired-x-bind-find-file'
     A function, which can be called interactively or in your
     `~/.emacs' file, that uses the value of
     `dired-x-hands-off-my-keys' to determine if `dired-x-find-file'
     should be bound over `find-file' and
     `dired-x-find-file-other-window' bound over
     `find-file-other-window'.  See *Note Optional Installation File At
     Point::.

9 Miscellaneous Commands
************************

Miscellaneous features not fitting anywhere else:

`dired-find-subdir'
     Default: `nil'

     If non-`nil', Dired does not make a new buffer for a directory if
     it can be found (perhaps as subdirectory) in some existing Dired
     buffer.

     If there are several Dired buffers for a directory, the most
     recently used is chosen.

     Dired avoids switching to the current buffer, so that if you have a
     normal and a wildcard buffer for the same directory, `C-x d RET'
     will toggle between those two.

`M-G'
     (`dired-goto-subdir') Go to the header line of an inserted
     directory.  This command reads its argument, with completion
     derived from the names of the inserted subdirectories.

`dired-jump'
     Bound to `C-x C-j'.  Jump back to Dired: If in a file, edit the
     current directory and move to file's line.  If in Dired already,
     pop up a level and go to old directory's line.  In case the proper
     Dired file line cannot be found, refresh the Dired buffer and try
     again.

`dired-jump-other-window'
     Bound to `C-x 4 C-j'. Like `dired-jump', but to other window.

     These functions can be autoloaded so they work even though
     `dired-x.el' has not been loaded yet (*note Optional Installation
     Dired Jump::).

     If the variable `dired-bind-jump' is `nil', `dired-jump' will not
     be bound to `C-x C-j' and `dired-jump-other-window' will not be
     bound to `C-x 4 C-j'.

`dired-vm'
     Bound to `V' if `dired-bind-vm' is `t'.  Run VM on this file
     (assumed to be a UNIX mail folder).

     If you give this command a prefix argument, it will visit the
     folder read-only.

     If the variable `dired-vm-read-only-folders' is `t', `dired-vm'
     will visit all folders read-only.  If it is neither `nil' nor `t',
     e.g., the symbol `if-file-read-only', only files not writable by
     you are visited read-only.

     If the variable `dired-bind-vm' is `t', `dired-vm' will be bound
     to `V'.  Otherwise, `dired-bind-rmail' will be bound.

`dired-rmail'
     Bound to `V' if `dired-bind-vm' is `nil'.  Run Rmail on this file
     (assumed to be mail folder in Rmail format).

`dired-info'
     Bound to `I'.  Run Info on this file (assumed to be a file in Info
     format).

     If the variable `dired-bind-info' is `nil', `dired-info' will not
     be bound to `I'.

`dired-man'
     Bound to `N'.  Run man on this file (assumed to be a file in
     `nroff' format).

     If the variable `dired-bind-man' is `nil', `dired-man' will not be
     bound to `N'.

`dired-do-relsymlink'
     Bound to `Y'.  Relative symlink all marked (or next ARG) files
     into a directory, or make a relative symbolic link to the current
     file.  This creates relative symbolic links like

              foo -> ../bar/foo

     not absolute ones like

              foo -> /ugly/path/that/may/change/any/day/bar/foo

`dired-do-relsymlink-regexp'
     Bound to `%Y'.  Relative symlink all marked files containing
     REGEXP to NEWNAME.  See functions `dired-do-rename-regexp' and
     `dired-do-relsymlink' for more info.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
