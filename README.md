# Building

## Bootstrap

To bootstrap the build you need to run `./configure` (in the root of the source tree). You can set a few (environment) variables read by this script that change the generated build file:

* `builddir` — location of built files. Defaults to `~/build/TextMate`.
* `identity` — for Apple’s `codesign`. Defaults to ad-hoc signing, which does not use an identity at all.
* `boostdir` — location of boost includes. By default it will search various locations including MacPorts and Homebrew.
* `sparsedir` — location of sparsehash includes. By default it will search various locations including MacPorts and Homebrew.

In the simplest case (assuming [Homebrew][] is installed) you would run:

```sh
brew install ragel boost multimarkdown ninja capnp google-sparsehash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/textmate/textmate.git
cd textmate
./configure && ninja
```

If you're using [MacPorts][] then instead run this line to install dependencies:

```sh
sudo port install ninja ragel boost multimarkdown sparsehash
```

Unless you’re using [Homebrew][] then [Cap’n Proto][capnp] must be manually installed. Feel free to submit a PR to update `configure`.

If `port` fails with a build error then likely you need to agree (system-wide) to Apple’s Xcode license:

```sh
sudo xcodebuild -license
```

## Prerequisites

Building TextMate has the following dependencies:

 * [ninja][]         — build system similar to `make`
 * [ragel][]         — state machine compiler
 * [boost][]         — portable C++ source libraries
 * [sparsehash][]    — A cache friendly hash_map
 * [multimarkdown][] — marked-up plain text compiler
 * [Cap’n Proto][capnp] — serialization library

## Building from within TextMate

You should install the [Ninja][NinjaBundle] bundle which can be installed via _Preferences_ → _Bundles_.

After this you can press ⌘B to build from within TextMate. In case you haven't already you also need to set up the `PATH` variable either in _Preferences_ → _Variables_ or `~/.tm_properties` so it can find `ninja` and related tools; an example could be `$PATH:/opt/local/bin`.

The default target is `TextMate/run`. This will relaunch TextMate but when called from within TextMate, a dialog will appear before the current instance is killed. As there is full session restore, it is safe to relaunch even with unsaved changes.

If the current file is a test file then the target to build is changed to build the library to which the test belongs (this is done by setting `TM_NINJA_TARGET` in the `.tm_properties` file found in the root of the source tree).

Similarly, if the current file belongs to an application target (other than `TextMate.app`) then `TM_NINJA_TARGET` is set to build and run this application.

## Build Targets

For the `TextMate.app` application there are two symbolic build targets:

```sh
ninja TextMate      # Build and sign TextMate
ninja TextMate/run  # Build, sign, and (re)launch TextMate
```

To clean everything run:

```sh
ninja -t clean
```
