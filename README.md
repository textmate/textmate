# Building

## Setup

To build TextMate, you need the following:

 * [boost][]            — portable C++ source libraries
 * [Cap’n Proto][capnp] — serialization library
 * [multimarkdown][]    — marked-up plain text compiler
 * [ninja][]            — build system similar to `make`
 * [ragel][]            — state machine compiler
 * [sparsehash][]       — a cache friendly `hash_map`

All this can be installed using either [Homebrew][] or [MacPorts][]:

```sh
# Homebrew
brew install boost capnp google-sparsehash multimarkdown ninja ragel

# MacPorts
sudo port install boost capnproto multimarkdown ninja ragel sparsehash
```

After installing dependencies, make sure you have a full checkout (including submodules) and then run `./configure` followed by `ninja`, for example:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/textmate/textmate.git
cd textmate
./configure && ninja TextMate/run
```

The `./configure` script simply checks that all dependencies can be found, and then calls `bin/rave` to bootstrap a `build.ninja` file with default config set to `release` and default target set to `TextMate`.

## Building from within TextMate

You should install the [Ninja][NinjaBundle] bundle which can be installed via _Preferences_ → _Bundles_.

After this you can press ⌘B to build from within TextMate. In case you haven't already you also need to set up the `PATH` variable either in _Preferences_ → _Variables_ or `~/.tm_properties` so it can find `ninja` and related tools; an example could be `$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.

The default target (set in `.tm_properties`) is `TextMate/run`. This will relaunch TextMate but when called from within TextMate, a dialog will appear before the current instance is killed. As there is full session restore, it is safe to relaunch even with unsaved changes.

If the current file is a test file then the target to build is changed to build the library to which the test belongs (this is done by setting `TM_NINJA_TARGET` in the `.tm_properties` file found in the root of the source tree).

Similarly, if the current file belongs to an application target (other than `TextMate.app`) then `TM_NINJA_TARGET` is set to build and run this application.

## Build Targets

For the `TextMate.app` application there are two symbolic build targets:

```sh
ninja TextMate      # Build and sign TextMate
ninja TextMate/run  # Build, sign, and (re)launch TextMate
```

To clean everything run:

```sh
ninja -t clean
```

Or simply delete `~/build/TextMate`.
