To generate these refcards, you need to install the TeX document
production system.  For example, http://www.tug.org/texlive/ .

All modern GNU/Linux distributions provide TeX packages, so the
easiest way is just to install those.  Your distribution may have
split some of the files needed to process non-English output into
separate, optional packages such as: texlive-lang-cyrillic,
texlive-lang-czechslovak, texlive-lang-german, and texlive-lang-polish.
