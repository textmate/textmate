* Introduction  -*-grep-*-     (See the end of file for copyright information)

This shows the different kinds of messages grep recognizes by default and
how they are rendered.  It is intended both to help you decide which matchers
you need and as a test of the matchers.  Move the mouse over a colored part
to see how much text was actually matched.

Please do not edit this file in grep-mode, it may lose escape
sequences on saving.  Visit this file literally for editing.
