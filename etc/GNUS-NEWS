* Installation changes

** Upgrading from previous (stable) version if you have used No Gnus.

If you have tried No Gnus (the unstable Gnus branch leading to this
release) but went back to a stable version, be careful when upgrading to
this version.  In particular, you will probably want to remove the
`~/News/marks' directory (perhaps selectively), so that flags are read
from your `~/.newsrc.eld' instead of from the stale marks file, where
this release will store flags for nntp.  See a later entry for more
information about nntp marks.  Note that downgrading isn't safe in
general.

** Incompatibility when switching from Emacs 23 to Emacs 22 In Emacs 23,
Gnus uses Emacs' new internal coding system `utf-8-emacs' for saving
articles drafts and `~/.newsrc.eld'.  These files may not be read
correctly in Emacs 22 and below.  If you want to use Gnus across
different Emacs versions, you may set `mm-auto-save-coding-system' to
`emacs-mule'.

** Lisp files are now installed in `.../site-lisp/gnus/' by default.  It
defaulted to `.../site-lisp/' formerly.  In addition to this, the new
installer issues a warning if other Gnus installations which will shadow
the latest one are detected.  You can then remove those shadows manually
or remove them using `make remove-installed-shadows'.

** The installation directory name is allowed to have spaces and/or tabs.


* New packages and libraries within Gnus

** Gnus includes the Emacs Lisp SASL library.

This provides a clean API to SASL mechanisms from within Emacs.  The
user visible aspects of this, compared to the earlier situation, include
support for DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM.   *Note Emacs SASL: (sasl)Top.

** ManageSieve connections uses the SASL library by default.

The primary change this brings is support for DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM, when
the server supports it.

** Gnus includes a password cache mechanism in password-cache.el.

It is enabled by default (see `password-cache'), with a short timeout of
16 seconds (see `password-cache-expiry').  If PGG is used as the PGP
back end, the PGP passphrase is managed by this mechanism.  Passwords
for ManageSieve connections are managed by this mechanism, after
querying the user about whether to do so.

** Using EasyPG with Gnus When EasyPG, is available, Gnus will use it
instead of PGG.  EasyPG is an Emacs user interface to GNU Privacy Guard.
 *Note EasyPG Assistant user's manual: (epa)Top.  EasyPG is included in
Emacs 23 and available separately as well.


* Changes in group mode

** Old intermediate incoming mail files (`Incoming*') are deleted after a
couple of days, not immediately.  *Note Mail Source Customization::.
(New in Gnus 5.10.10 / Emacs 22.2)



* Changes in summary and article mode

** Gnus now supports sticky article buffers.  Those are article buffers
that are not reused when you select another article.  *Note Sticky
Articles::.

** Gnus can selectively display `text/html' articles with a WWW browser
with `K H'.  *Note MIME Commands::.

** International host names (IDNA) can now be decoded inside article bodies
using `W i' (`gnus-summary-idna-message').  This requires that GNU Libidn
(`http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/') has been installed.

** The non-ASCII group names handling has been much improved.  The back
ends that fully support non-ASCII group names are now `nntp', `nnml',
and `nnrss'.  Also the agent, the cache, and the marks features work
with those back ends.  *Note Non-ASCII Group Names::.

** Gnus now displays DNS master files sent as text/dns using dns-mode.

** Gnus supports new limiting commands in the Summary buffer: `/ r'
(`gnus-summary-limit-to-replied') and `/ R'
(`gnus-summary-limit-to-recipient').  *Note Limiting::.

** You can now fetch all ticked articles from the server using `Y t'
(`gnus-summary-insert-ticked-articles').  *Note Summary Generation
Commands::.

** Gnus supports a new sort command in the Summary buffer: `C-c C-s C-t'
(`gnus-summary-sort-by-recipient').  *Note Summary Sorting::.

** S/MIME now features LDAP user certificate searches.  You need to
configure the server in `smime-ldap-host-list'.

** URLs inside OpenPGP headers are retrieved and imported to your PGP key
ring when you click on them.

** Picons can be displayed right from the textual address, see
`gnus-picon-style'.  *Note Picons::.

** ANSI SGR control sequences can be transformed using `W A'.

ANSI sequences are used in some Chinese hierarchies for highlighting
articles (`gnus-article-treat-ansi-sequences').

** Gnus now MIME decodes articles even when they lack "MIME-Version" header.
This changes the default of `gnus-article-loose-mime'.

** `gnus-decay-scores' can be a regexp matching score files.  For example,
set it to `\\.ADAPT\\'' and only adaptive score files will be decayed.
 *Note Score Decays::.

** Strings prefixing to the `To' and `Newsgroup' headers in summary lines
when using `gnus-ignored-from-addresses' can be customized with
`gnus-summary-to-prefix' and `gnus-summary-newsgroup-prefix'.  *Note To
From Newsgroups::.

** You can replace MIME parts with external bodies.  See
`gnus-mime-replace-part' and `gnus-article-replace-part'.  *Note MIME
Commands::, *note Using MIME::.

** The option `mm-fill-flowed' can be used to disable treatment of
format=flowed messages.  Also, flowed text is disabled when sending
inline PGP signed messages.  *Note Flowed text: (emacs-mime)Flowed text.
(New in Gnus 5.10.7)

** Now the new command `S W' (`gnus-article-wide-reply-with-original') for
a wide reply in the article buffer yanks a text that is in the active
region, if it is set, as well as the `R'
(`gnus-article-reply-with-original') command.  Note that the `R' command
in the article buffer no longer accepts a prefix argument, which was
used to make it do a wide reply.  *Note Article Keymap::.

** The new command `C-h b' (`gnus-article-describe-bindings') used in the
article buffer now shows not only the article commands but also the real
summary commands that are accessible from the article buffer.



* Changes in Message mode

** Gnus now supports the "hashcash" client puzzle anti-spam mechanism.  Use
`(setq message-generate-hashcash t)' to enable.  *Note Hashcash::.

** You can now drag and drop attachments to the Message buffer.  See
`mml-dnd-protocol-alist' and `mml-dnd-attach-options'.  *Note MIME:
(message)MIME.

** The option `message-yank-empty-prefix' now controls how empty lines are
prefixed in cited text.  *Note Insertion Variables: (message)Insertion
Variables.

** Gnus uses narrowing to hide headers in Message buffers.  The
`References' header is hidden by default.  To make all headers visible,
use `(setq message-hidden-headers nil)'.  *Note Message Headers:
(message)Message Headers.

** You can highlight different levels of citations like in the article
buffer.  See `gnus-message-highlight-citation'.

** `auto-fill-mode' is enabled by default in Message mode.  See
`message-fill-column'.  *Note Message Headers: (message)Various Message
Variables.

** You can now store signature files in a special directory named
`message-signature-directory'.

** The option `message-citation-line-format' controls the format of the
"Whomever writes:" line.  You need to set
`message-citation-line-function' to
`message-insert-formatted-citation-line' as well.


* Changes in back ends

** The nntp back end stores article marks in `~/News/marks'.

The directory can be changed using the (customizable) variable
`nntp-marks-directory', and marks can be disabled using the (back end)
variable `nntp-marks-is-evil'.  The advantage of this is that you can
copy `~/News/marks' (using rsync, scp or whatever) to another Gnus
installation, and it will realize what articles you have read and
marked.  The data in `~/News/marks' has priority over the same data in
`~/.newsrc.eld'.

** You can import and export your RSS subscriptions from OPML files.  *Note
RSS::.

** IMAP identity (RFC 2971) is supported.

By default, Gnus does not send any information about itself, but you can
customize it using the variable `nnimap-id'.

** The `nnrss' back end now supports multilingual text.  Non-ASCII group
names for the `nnrss' groups are also supported.  *Note RSS::.

** Retrieving mail with POP3 is supported over SSL/TLS and with StartTLS.

** The nnml back end allows other compression programs beside `gzip' for
compressed message files.  *Note Mail Spool::.

** The nnml back end supports group compaction.

This feature, accessible via the functions `gnus-group-compact-group'
(`G z' in the group buffer) and `gnus-server-compact-server' (`z' in the
server buffer) renumbers all articles in a group, starting from 1 and
removing gaps.  As a consequence, you get a correct total article count
(until messages are deleted again).



* Appearance

** The tool bar has been updated to use GNOME icons.  You can also
customize the tool bars: `M-x customize-apropos RET -tool-bar$' should
get you started.  (Only for Emacs, not in XEmacs.)

** The tool bar icons are now (de)activated correctly in the group buffer,
see the variable `gnus-group-update-tool-bar'.  Its default value
depends on your Emacs version.

** You can change the location of XEmacs' toolbars in Gnus buffers.  See
`gnus-use-toolbar' and `message-use-toolbar'.



* Miscellaneous changes

** Having edited the select-method for the foreign server in the server
buffer is immediately reflected to the subscription of the groups which
use the server in question.  For instance, if you change
`nntp-via-address' into `bar.example.com' from `foo.example.com', Gnus
will connect to the news host by way of the intermediate host
`bar.example.com' from next time.

** The `all.SCORE' file can be edited from the group buffer using `W e'.

** You can set `gnus-mark-copied-or-moved-articles-as-expirable' to a
non-`nil' value so that articles that have been read may be marked as
expirable automatically when copying or moving them to a group that has
auto-expire turned on.  The default is `nil' and copying and moving of
articles behave as before; i.e., the expirable marks will be unchanged
except that the marks will be removed when copying or moving articles to
a group that has not turned auto-expire on.  *Note Expiring Mail::.
