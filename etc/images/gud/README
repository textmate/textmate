Some icons are derived from Red Hat's Insight Debugger:

"Insight is a graphical user interface to GDB, the GNU Debugger"

<http://sourceware.org/insight/aboutus.php>
"Insight is being released under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (GPL)"

In addition to the above, Red Hat has assigned (2002-11-09) copyright
for its work on GDB to the Free Software Foundation (as well as a
blanket assignment for all changes to FSF software, 1999-10-21, until
terminated with 30 days notice). In an email exchange with Richard
Stallman <rms at gnu.org> in November 2002, Red Hat confirmed that
their copyright assignment included the icons.
