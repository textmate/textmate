* The default GTK icons were not overridden by the GNOME theme due to
  a bug which was fixed in GNOME 2.15. Once GNOME 2.16 is in wide
  circulation, the GTK icons should be replaced with the equivalent
  GNOME icons.

* Recipe for Creating PBM Versions

1. Edit .xpm image in GIMP.
2. Image > Mode > Indexed. Check Use Black/White Palette and No
   Color Dithering.
3. File > Save As file.xbm.
4. Run xbmtopbm < file.xbm > file.pbm.

  Some icons in the mail/ and gnus/ subdirectories are also taken
  from this source (see their separate README files).

The images in the low-color/ subdirectory are low-color versions of
the files of the same name in this directory, and are subject to the
same conditions.
